<p id="">Crafting the perfect resume is no small feat. Many job seekers struggle with deciding whether to write their resumes themselves or to hire a professional. With employers taking an average of just six seconds to glance at a resume, getting it right can mean the difference between landing an interview and getting passed over.</p><p id="">This guide offers insights into both approaches, helping you weigh the pros and cons based on your unique situation.</p><p id="">We've seen firsthand <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/why-tailoring-your-resume-is-key-to-landing-your-dream-job" id="">how the right resume can open doors for job seekers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id="">From understanding applicant tracking systems (ATS) that companies use to filter candidates, to maximizing your personal branding in every line of your resume, we bring a wealth of knowledge about what hiring managers are looking for.</p><p id="">Whether you're tempted by the DIY route or considering professional help, this guide will point you toward making an informed decision that suits your goals. Ready? Let's get started.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Evaluating Your Needs and Capabilities</strong></h2><p id="">Assess your career complexity and time availability for resume writing to determine if you should DIY or hire a professional.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Complexity of your career history</strong></h3><p id="">Your career history might be hard to put on paper. If you've had many jobs or worked in different fields, showing off your skills can feel tough. Professional resume writers are good at making complex histories look great.</p><p id="">They focus on what you did well at each job instead of just listing duties. This makes your resume <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/how-to-leverage-recruiters-in-your-job-search" id="">stand out to recruiters</a>.</p><p id="">Professional writers turn a rich career into a compelling story. Using professional help is smart if your job search feels complicated. These experts know how LinkedIn works and how to keep resumes away from the spam folder.&nbsp;</p><p id="">They also provide advice that's just right for your situation, like not sharing college graduation dates if you finished more than 20 years ago.</p><p id="">This keeps your application moving smoothly through recruiting software and into the right inbox.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Time availability for resume crafting</strong></h3><p id="">Crafting a resume takes a lot of time and effort. You need to think about your job history, skills, and how to show yourself in the best light. This means putting together your self-presentation in a clear and creative way.</p><p id="">Some people might have hours to spend on this process, while others might only find a few minutes here and there between work and life duties.</p><p id="">On one side, doing it yourself lets you control every part of the creative process. You decide what goes on your resume and how it looks. But this needs time for thinking, writing, and proofreading to make sure everything is perfect.</p><p id="">It's important because mistakes or a generic look can make your resume less effective at getting job offers. On the other hand, not having enough time could mean rushing through this task without giving it the attention it deserves.</p><blockquote id="">Did you know?<em id=""> Leonardo da Vinci is often considered the ‘’father of the resume.’’ Though his application wasn't quite the standard format we use today, it was a letter written around 1482 highlighting his skills to Ludovico Sforza, a potential employer.</em></blockquote><h2 id=""><strong id="">DIY Resume Writing</strong></h2><p id="">Crafting your resume yourself gives you control and saves money. However, it requires time and expertise.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Pros &amp; Cons (DIY Resume Writing)</strong></h3><p id="">Exploring the advantages and downsides of <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/steps-for-building-a-resume" id="">DIY resume writing</a> reveals various factors to consider. Here's a detailed look:</p><p id=""><strong id="">Pros</strong></p><ul id=""><li id="">Low cost</li><li id="">Control over content</li><li id="">Flexibility in updates</li></ul><p id=""><strong id="">Cons</strong></p><ul id=""><li id="">Requires significant time</li><li id="">May lack ATS optimization</li><li id="">Potential for errors</li><li id="">DIY resumes may be generic and less impactful</li><li id="">DIY resume writing might result in missed opportunities and decreased competitiveness</li></ul><p id="">Writing your resume on your own can save money. You get to pick what to include in it. Updating it anytime is easy too. But, this route eats up a lot of your time.</p><p id="">Without the right tools, your resume might not pass the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Simple mistakes can slip through. Often, DIY resumes don't stand out much.</p><p id="">They might cause you to miss great job chances, making you less competitive.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Professional Resume Writing Services</strong></h2><p id="">Consider the benefits of professional resume writing services, and how they can enhance your job-searching journey.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Pros &amp; Cons (Professional Resume Writing Services)</strong></h3><p id="">Exploring the advantages and drawbacks of professional resume writing services can guide you in making an informed decision.

By incorporating these industry-specific terms often missed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), they can unlock hidden job opportunities you might not have otherwise found.</em></blockquote><h2 id=""><strong id="">Cost Comparison</strong></h2><p id="">When comparing costs, consider various fees and services.</p><p id="">Explore the differences between DIY and professional service pricing.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">DIY vs. Professional Services</strong></h3><p id="">Choosing between DIY resume writing and hiring professional services depends on various factors, such as your budget, time, and the complexity of your career history. To help you make an informed decision, here is a comparison in an easy-to-understand factors to consider in cost comparison:</p><h4 id=""><strong id="">Cost</strong></h4><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">DIY: </strong>Free to low cost, using tools like <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/level-up-your-job-search-with-ai-that-applies-to-jobs-for-you" id="">AI resume builders</a> for content suggestions.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Professional:</strong> Can range from $50 for coding-related resume services to $1,500-$5,000 for experienced writers.</li></ul><h4 id=""><strong id="">Time Investment</strong></h4><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">DIY:</strong> Varies based on your skill level; could take several hours to perfect.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Professional: </strong>Minimal time needed from you; the service handles most of the work.

Evaluate your career history complexity and time availability before deciding whether to do it yourself or seek professional help.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Factors to consider before deciding</strong></h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Professional Expertise:</strong> Ensure the resume writer possesses certifications from reputable organizations such as the <a href="https://parwcc.com/page/CPRW_new" id="">CPRW</a> or <a href="https://thenrwa.org/NCRW" id="">NCRW</a>, indicating their commitment to ethical conduct and quality output.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Technology Integration:</strong> Verify that the chosen writer is adept in utilizing <a href="https://www.greenhouse.com/" id="">ATS principles </a>to enhance your resume's visibility and relevance in the digital realm.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Formatting Savvy:</strong> Prioritize writers who understand the critical balance between ATS compatibility and human readability, maximizing your resume's impact.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Reputation and Track Record:</strong> Research authentic reviews and testimonials to gauge the writer's ability to craft compelling resumes that align with industry standards and expectations.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Adaptability to Market Trends:</strong> Choose a writer with a deep understanding of evolving recruitment preferences, demonstrated by a preference for <a href="https://novoresume.com/career-blog/2-page-resume" id="">contemporary two-page resumes</a> over traditional one-page formats.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Cost-Value Assessment:</strong> Assess the overall value proposition offered by professional services against the potential time investment required for DIY writing, ensuring privacy and user agreement integrity are not compromised.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Long-Term Benefits:</strong> Consider how confident you feel with your final product; weigh this against any potential challenges or gaps if opting for a DIY approach</li></ol><blockquote id="">Key takeaway:<em id=""> A strong resume goes beyond listing responsibilities.

If your job history is complex or you're pressed for time, a pro can make your life easier.</p><p id="">They know how to get past Applicant Tracking Systems. These systems pick resumes based on certain words that match the job's needs.</p><p id="">On the other hand, creating your own resume lets you control every part of it. You'll save money too. But, without knowing how these tracking systems work, you might miss out on a lot of opportunities.</p><p id="">Think about costs too. Hiring someone costs more but could lead to better jobs faster. Writing your own resume is cheaper but takes more time and effort.</p><p id="">Before deciding, consider how fast you need a job, how much money you can spend, and how comfortable you are writing about your resume and presenting your achievements.</p><p id="">Both options have good points and not-so-good ones. The best choice relies on your personal situation and goals, so choose wisely.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">FAQs</strong></h2><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><!-- ↓ Do not change the code ↓ -->
