Employers often find potential hires more attractive when they're currently working somewhere else, viewing them as valuable assets in the open market.</p><p id="">In some instances, you might be on an autopilot work mode at your current job, feeling unchallenged or underappreciated. Perhaps it's the desire for a higher salary, better benefits or flexibility that's causing this shift in focus towards finding new employment opportunities.</p><p id="">Whatever the reason may be for contemplating such a career move - whether it’s escaping from a hostile job environment or aiming to shorten your daily commute time - understanding your motivation is pivotal not just to make that decision but also to guide future actions during this transition period.</p><p id="">Ultimately <strong id="">setting clear and honest career goals</strong> will help you navigate through this change smoothly without threatening professional credibility or raising security threat perception at both ends – present and potential employers.</p><h2 id="">Steps to Successfully Change Jobs While Employed</h2><p id="">Assess your current employment situation, define your career goals, clean up your digital presence, and update your CV and LinkedIn profile.</p><h3 id="">Assess Your Current Employment Situation</h3><p id="">In the journey of changing jobs while employed, a significant first step involves taking an honest look at your <strong id="">existing employment situation</strong>.
