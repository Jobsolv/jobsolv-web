With <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/impact-of-applicant-tracking-systems-on-your-job-applications" target="_blank" id="">recruiters spending only <strong id="">7 seconds initially scanning a resume</strong></a>, it’s vital to make yours stand out. This article will guide you through the best types and sizes of fonts that will <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/expert-advice-on-effective-resume-building-tips-and-length" target="_blank" id="">give your resume a <strong id="">professional look</strong> and <strong id="">catch the eye of hiring managers</strong></a>.</p><p id="">Ready to <strong id="">boost your chances</strong> at <strong id="">landing that dream job</strong>? Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="">Key Takeaways</h2><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Choosing the right font is crucial</strong> for creating a professional and easily readable resume. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-font-resume" target="_blank" id=""><strong id="">Stick to classic fonts</strong></a> like Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri in 12-point size.</li><li id=""><a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/resume-fonts-which-to-use-which-to-ditch-v2/#Which%20Resume%20Fonts%20to%20Avoid" target="_blank" id=""><strong id="">Avoid unconventional fonts</strong></a> like Comic Sans or Brush Script, as they can come across as unprofessional and detract from the overall impression of your resume.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Consider using larger font sizes for headings and names</strong> to make them stand out, but be sure to keep it consistent throughout your document.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Serif fonts like Times New Roman are commonly used in traditional roles, while sans</strong> — serif fonts like Calibri are recommended for modern style job applications. It’s important to select a font that matches the industry and role you’re applying for.</li></ul><h2 id="">Importance of Choosing the Right Font for Your Resume</h2><p id="">The font you select for your resume plays a <strong id="">critical role</strong> in making the right first impression. It’s not just about <strong id="">aesthetics</strong>, but also about <strong id="">legibility</strong>, <strong id="">professionalism</strong>, and <strong id="">overall readability</strong> of your content.</p><p id="">A <strong id="">well-chosen font</strong> ensures that <strong id="">recruiters or HR managers</strong> can easily scan through your resume within those crucial <strong id="">7 seconds</strong> they typically spend on each document. The more legible and clean your text is, the more likely it will be read thoroughly.</p><p id="">Apart from good readability, choosing an appropriate font also signifies professionalism and <strong id="">attention to detail</strong>. Creative roles may permit a wider range of fonts; however, <strong id="">traditional roles</strong> often suggest <strong id="">classic fonts</strong> such as Times New Roman or <strong id="">Garamond</strong>.</p><p id="">Furthermore, remember that many businesses use <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/impact-of-applicant-tracking-systems-on-your-job-applications" target="_blank" id=""><strong id="">CV screening software</strong> or ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)</a>. Some fonts are more compatible with these systems than others — for instance <strong id="">sans-serif fonts</strong> like <strong id="">Calibri</strong> and Helvetica frequently come recommended as <strong id="">ATS-friendly options</strong>.</p><p id="">In conclusion, selecting an ideal font can greatly contribute to creating a <strong id="">professional and well-organized resume</strong> attractive to both <strong id="">human eyes</strong> and <strong id="">computerized systems</strong>.</p><h2 id="">Commonly Used Resume Fonts</h2><p id="">Commonly used resume fonts include Times New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Calibri, and Georgia.</p><h2 id="">Times New Roman</h2><p id="">A <strong id="">staple in the world of fonts</strong>, Times New Roman remains a solid choice for crafting an effective resume. As one of the most common resume fonts, it <strong id="">exudes professionalism and legibility</strong>.</p><p id="">Originating from the times of the Roman emperor, as its name implies, this font evokes a sense of tradition and trustworthiness. It’s <strong id="">highly recognizable</strong> and often associated with corporate use due to its frequent appearance in Microsoft Office applications.</p><p id="">However, be aware that while Times New Roman is not outdated per se, it could come across as too conventional or unoriginal when applied to more modern style job applications. For these scenarios, applicants might want to consider <strong id="">space-efficient sans-serif fonts</strong> such as Verdana or Arial.</p><p id="">Keep in mind as well that consistency is key; <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/level-up-your-quest-customize-your-resume-and-cover-letter" target="_blank" id="">your cover letter should match your resume’s chosen font type</a> to ensure a cohesive presentation for HR managers’ review process.</p><h2 id="">Arial</h2><p id="">The Arial font is a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/learn/blog/best-fonts-for-your-resumes" target="_blank" id=""><strong id="">popular choice among professional fonts</strong></a> to use on your resume.

Arial’s versatility also translates well across various formats including both PDF and Microsoft Word documents, ensuring that no matter how you submit your application, the format retains its integrity.</p><p id="">The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto" target="_blank" id="">Noto font family</a> serves as an excellent alternative if you’re looking for varied language scripts in both serif and sans-serif options.</p><h2 id="">Helvetica</h2><p id="">Helvetica is a <strong id="">commonly used sans-serif font</strong> that is <strong id="">known for its beauty and readability</strong>.

Its <strong id="">modern appearance adds a touch of sophistication</strong> to your resume while maintaining legibility.</p><h2 id="">Calibri</h2><p id="">Calibri is a <strong id="">contemporary font</strong> that offers a <strong id="">clean and modern look</strong> to your resume. It is often chosen for its <strong id="">professional appearance</strong> and <strong id="">ease of readability</strong>. As one of the default fonts in Microsoft Office, Calibri provides <strong id="">compatibility across different platforms and applications</strong>.</p><p id="">Its rounded edges make it visually appealing, while its simplicity ensures clarity and legibility.

It is known for its <strong id="">classic and professional appearance</strong>, making it a popular choice among job seekers. Georgia offers <strong id="">good readability</strong> both in print and on screen, which is important since employers often review resumes electronically.</p><p id="">This font has a slightly <strong id="">larger x-height</strong> compared to other serif fonts, meaning that the lowercase letters are taller and easier to read. As one of the font options commonly used by big corporations, Georgia conveys professionalism and trustworthiness to potential employers.</p><h2 id="">Best Fonts for Resume in 2023</h2><p id="">In 2023, some of the best fonts to use on your resume include Avenir Next, Cambria, Garamond, Gill Sans, and Constantia.</p><h2 id="">Avenir Next</h2><p id="">Avenir Next is considered one of the <strong id="">best fonts for resumes</strong> in 2023.

Using a universal resume font like Cambria ensures that your resume will open on any computer without formatting issues.</p><h2 id="">Garamond</h2><p id="">Garamond is a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/best-resume-fonts-you-cant-go-wrong-with-according-ceo-who-reads-thousands-of-resumes-a-year.html" target="_blank" id=""><strong id="">highly recommended font</strong></a> for resumes in 2023.

Its classic design adds a touch of sophistication to your resume while maintaining readability.</p><p id="">When using Constantia or any other font on your resume, be sure to use an <strong id="">appropriate font size</strong> that complements the overall layout and ensures all content fits within one page.</p><h2 id="">Worst Resume Fonts to Avoid</h2><p id="">Avoid using the following fonts on your resume: Futura, Courier, Brush Script, Comic Sans, and Papyrus.</p><h2 id="">Futura</h2><p id="">Futura is a font that is <strong id="">often used on resumes</strong>, but it <strong id="">should be avoided</strong> due to its overuse and <strong id="">difficulty to read at small sizes</strong>. Recruiters and hiring managers typically spend only 7 seconds scanning a resume, so readability is crucial.</p><p id="">Futura’s geometric design may look modern, but it can be challenging to decipher in small print. It is best to choose a font that is clean, legible, and professional for your resume.</p><h2 id="">Courier</h2><p id="">Courier is considered one of the <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/resume-fonts-which-to-use-which-to-ditch-v2/" target="_blank" id=""><strong id="">worst fonts</strong></a> to use on a resume. It is often overused and can be <strong id="">hard to read</strong>, especially at <strong id="">smaller sizes</strong>. Using Courier can make your resume look <strong id="">outdated and unnatural</strong>, as it has <strong id="">monospaced letter spacing</strong> that may not be visually appealing.</p><p id="">This font is not recommended for serious contexts in a resume, as it is associated with a <strong id="">retro and nostalgic appearance</strong> that can look cheap and dated. To create a professional impression, it’s best to avoid using Courier on your resume.</p><h2 id="">Brush Script</h2><p id="">Brush Script is a font that should be avoided when creating your resume. It is often <strong id="">overused and considered cheap and dated</strong>. Additionally, Brush Script can be <strong id="">hard to read at small sizes</strong>, making it less effective in conveying your information to recruiters and hiring managers who typically spend just 7 seconds scanning a resume.</p><p id="">Instead, opt for <strong id="">classic and easily readable fonts</strong> like Times New Roman or <strong id="">serif fonts such as Cambria, Georgia, Garamond, Book Antiqua, or Didot</strong>. These fonts are more professional and will help make a good impression on potential employers.</p><h2 id="">Comic Sans</h2><p id="">Comic Sans is <strong id="">widely regarded as one of the worst fonts</strong> to use on a resume. It is often seen as <strong id="">unprofessional and childish</strong>, which can create a <strong id="">negative impression with recruiters and hiring managers</strong>.</p><p id="">Using Comic Sans can make your resume <strong id="">look amateurish</strong> and <strong id="">detract from the overall professionalism</strong> of your application. It’s best to avoid this font and choose something more suitable for the job market.</p><h2 id="">Papyrus</h2><p id="">Papyrus is a <strong id="">commonly used font</strong> for resumes, but it <strong id="">should be avoided</strong>. This font is overused and can be <strong id="">hard to read at small sizes</strong>. Its exaggerated, swirly design may make your resume appear <strong id="">unprofessional and difficult to take seriously</strong>.</p><p id="">It’s best to opt for a more professional and easily legible font for your resume that will make a stronger impression on potential employers.</p><h2 id="">Understanding the Ideal Resume Font Size</h2><p id="">The <strong id="">ideal font size for a resume is typically 12 points</strong>. This ensures that the text is easily readable without appearing too small or too large. Recruiters and hiring managers often spend only around 7 seconds scanning a resume, so it’s important to make the content easily digestible.</p><p id="">However, <strong id="">larger font sizes can be used strategically to emphasize certain elements</strong> like your name or section headings. It’s also worth noting that if your content extends beyond one page, you can decrease the font size slightly (to around 10 points) as long as you <strong id="">use a sans-serif font for better legibility</strong>.</p><p id="">Remember, creating a visually appealing and professional-looking resume is key to making a positive first impression in those crucial few seconds of review time.</p><h2 id="">Serif vs. Sans-Serif: Which One to Choose</h2><p id="">Deciding between serif and sans-<strong id="">serif fonts</strong> can be a critical part of creating an effective resume.</p><p id="">- Serif fonts, such as Times New Roman, have small lines or strokes attached to the end of larger strokes in a letter or symbol. These are perceived as being more <strong id="">formal and traditional</strong>.</p><p id="">- Cambria and Georgia are also serif fonts, known for being <strong id="">easy to read</strong>, both online and in print.</p><p id="">- Garamond is a serif font that is recommended for its <strong id="">professional appearance</strong>.</p><p id="">- On the other hand, <strong id="">sans-serif fonts</strong>, like Calibri and Helvetica, do not have these extra strokes and generally appear more <strong id="">modern and minimalist</strong>.</p><p id="">- Calibri is a contemporary sans-serif font that offers a professional and readable style.</p><p id="">- Helvetica is a popular typeface thanks to its beautiful design and <strong id="">readability</strong>.</p><p id="">- Other viable sans-serif options include Verdana, Trebuchet MS, and Lato.</p><p id="">- It’s typically advised to stick with one font type throughout your resume for consistency.</p><p id="">- The choice between serif and sans-serif largely depends on the industry and the impression you want to make. Traditional industries might prefer serif, while modern or creative fields could be more drawn to sans-serif.</p><p id="">- Remember, the primary goal is readability. If the font is easy to read and presents your information clearly, it’s an excellent choice.</p><h2 id="">How to Format Your Resume with the Chosen Font</h2><ul id=""><li id="">Use a <strong id="">consistent font</strong> throughout your resume to maintain a professional and cohesive look.</li><li id="">Choose a font size that is <strong id="">easily readable</strong> but not too large or small. The <strong id="">recommended font size</strong> for a resume is 12 points.</li><li id="">Use larger fonts, around 14 or 16 points, for your name and section headings to make them stand out.</li><li id="">Bolding, italicizing, and capitalizing can be used to emphasize important information, such as job titles or achievements, but use them sparingly and consistently.</li><li id="">Maintain <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/master-compelling-resume-bullet-points-on-job-descriptions" target="_blank" id=""><strong id="">proper spacing between sections and bullet points</strong></a> to improve readability.</li><li id="">Ensure that your chosen font is compatible with different file formats by embedding the fonts in the file or converting it into a PDF format.</li><li id="">Pay attention to the overall layout of your resume, including margins, line spacing, and alignment. Make sure it looks clean and well organized.</li><li id="">Proofread your resume carefully to check for any formatting errors or inconsistent font usage before submitting it.</li></ul><h2 id="">Key Takeaways: Best Resume Fonts and Sizes</h2><p id="">In conclusion, choosing the right font for your resume is crucial for creating a professional and easily readable document. Stick to <strong id="">classic and widely accepted fonts</strong> like Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri in <strong id="">12-point size</strong>.</p><p id="">Avoid <strong id="">distracting or unconventional fonts</strong> like <strong id="">Comic Sans or Brush Script</strong>.
