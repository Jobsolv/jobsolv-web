<p id="">‍<a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/apply-to-jobs-with-reverse-recruiter-let-us-find-your-career">Applying for jobs </a>can bring surprises, especially if employers check your background. Over 93% of them do this before hiring. Our guide will show you how to check yourself first. A pre-employment background check to <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/overcoming-job-search-challenges-your-guide-to-success" id="">avoid bumps on your job search road</a>.</p><p id="">Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Conducting a Pre-Employment Background Check on Yourself</strong></h2><p id="">Verify your identity and review potential screening results as part of running a pre-employment background check on yourself.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Uncovering Potential Identity Theft</strong></h3><p id="">Checking for identity theft is key during a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/policies/background-check-policy-procedure" id="">self background check</a>. This means looking closely at your credit reports from major bureaus like Equifax to spot any strange activity or unknown accounts.</p><p id="">It's crucial because identity thieves might use your information for loans or credit cards, leaving you with the damage.</p><p id="">Identity theft can turn your life upside down, making it vital to catch early.</p><p id="">Services that monitor your credit all the time help find these issues quickly. They alert you about changes in your report, helping stop identity theft before it grows worse. Always keep an eye on your financial statements and watch for signs of unauthorized actions.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Identifying Possible Background Screening Results</strong></h3><p id="">You will find many types of information in background screen results. Your report might show your work history, where you went to school, and any times you broke the law. It could also list minor offenses or more serious charges like felonies.</p><p id="">The report checks if you are on any watch lists too. This all comes from public records, federal databases, and sometimes social media.</p><p id="">Next up is how to do a check on yourself. You'll need some personal details first.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">The Process of Running a Self Background Check</strong></h2><p id="">Running a self background check involves gathering personal information, searching court records, checking credit reports, reviewing online presence, verifying educational and employment history, and checking professional licenses and certifications.</p><blockquote id=""><em id="">Background checks are a common part of the hiring process. Be proactive and take control of your information.</em></blockquote><h2 id=""><strong id="">Gathering Personal Information</strong></h2><p id="">Start your self background check by collecting your personal details. First, list all the places you have lived in the last seven to 10 years. This step is crucial for tracking where your records might be.</p><p id="">Make sure to include every address, even if you were there for a short time. Next, gather documents that prove who you are. These include your driver’s license and social security card.</p><p id="">After collecting these details, move on to searching court records. This part checks for any legal issues you might have had in those places.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Searching Court Records</strong></h2><p id="">To search court records, visit your local courthouse or its website. Costs for public records can range from a few dollars to over $25 per record depending on the location. This step helps you find criminal history, detentions, and any legal actions tied to your name.</p><p id="">Make sure you check in every state or county where you have lived.</p><p id="">Next, look at your credit reports to understand financial history employers might see.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Checking Credit Reports</strong></h2><p id="">After looking into court records, it's critical to check your credit reports as part of a pre-employment background check. By doing so, you can ensure that all the financial information associated with your name is accurate, up-to-date, and free from any suspicious activity.</p><p id="">To track potential identity theft or errors in your credit history, utilize the <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/2349" id="">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</a>, which entitles you to one free credit report yearly from each<a href="https://www.experian.com/credit/experian-equifax-transunion-credit-report-and-score/" id=""> major credit bureau - Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion</a>.</p><p id="">The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) allows for obtaining a free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Reviewing Online Presence</strong></h2><p id="">After checking your credit reports, it's crucial to review your online presence. This involves examining your social media accounts and online activities that may affect your professional image.</p><p id="">Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can provide insight into your personal life, behavior, and communication style. Take control of what potential employers might discover by ensuring that the content on these platforms reflects positively on you.</p><p id="">In addition to social media, consider conducting a search for any mentions or <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/choosing-the-right-professional-references-for-your-resume" id="">references of yourself</a> on news websites or other public platforms.&nbsp;</p><blockquote id=""><em id="">Pro Tip: Regularly review and adjust your social media posts and comments to project a professional image for potential employers. Avoid posting strong political opinions and be neutral.&nbsp;</em></blockquote><h2 id=""><strong id="">Verifying Educational and Employment History</strong></h2><p id="">Ensure accuracy by contacting your former schools you’ve attended. Additionally, verify work history through previous employers and professional organizations.</p><p id="">You can also opt to use reputable background check services to cross-reference your findings with official records.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Checking Professional Licenses and Certifications</strong></h2><p id="">After reviewing your educational and employment history, it's crucial to also check the validity of your professional licenses and certifications. This step ensures that the qualifications you possess are current, genuine, and in good standing.</p><p id="">Professional licenses can cover a broad spectrum including medical credentials, legal accreditations, trade certifications, or real estate licensure.</p><p id="">Ensuring the legitimacy of these licenses can be performed by contacting the relevant licensing boards or regulatory authorities.&nbsp;</p><p id="">For example, verifying a medical license involves checking with state medical boards or specialized verification regulatory authorities to confirm their status.</p><p id="">Similarly, for legal professionals such as attorneys or paralegals, their status can be verified through state bar associations' websites. Every state in the United States has a directory of all licensed attorneys in that state.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">What a Background Check Report Includes</strong></h2><p id="">A background check report comprises various details about a person's history, such as social security number trace, criminal records review, employment and education history verification, driving records examination, and credit history review.</p><p id="">It also encompasses information on professional licenses or certifications held by the individual.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Social Security Number Trace</strong></h3><p id="">A <a href="https://ciilink.com/background-screening-services/social-security-number-ssn-verification" id="">Social Security Number (SSN)</a> trace is a fundamental part of any background check. It provides crucial information on an individual's address history and associated names linked to their SSN.</p><p id="">This data forms the basis for further screening processes, enabling employers and individuals to verify identity, assess potential risk factors, and uncover any instances of identity theft or fraudulent activity related to the SSN.</p><p id="">Additionally, it aids in confirming the accuracy of personal details provided by an individual during the hiring process or self-checks.</p><p id="">The SSN trace draws from various official records, including credit reports, loan applications, and other financial transactions entailing the use of one's social security number.&nbsp;</p><p id="">These records are instrumental in discerning an applicant’s credibility and integrity while unraveling critical insights about their past engagements that can influence employment decisions.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Criminal Records Review</strong></h3><p id="">A <a href="https://www.instantcriminalchecks.com/employment-screening/" id="">criminal records review</a> uncovers felony and misdemeanor convictions, pending cases, and incarceration history as an adult. This check also reveals any arrests and whether the individual's record includes expunged or sealed offenses.</p><p id="">Additionally, it can provide insights into driving under the influence (DUI) and drug-related charges, helping individuals understand <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/background-checks-what-employers-need-know" id="">what potential employers might discover</a> when conducting a background check.</p><p id="">Moving on to "Employment History Verification"...</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Employment History Verification</strong></h3><p id="">Moving on from criminal records review, the next vital step in a self-background check is <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/how-do-background-checks-verify-employment" id="">employment history verification</a>. This process ensures accuracy and trustworthiness in your professional track record and can be done by contacting previous employers, collecting pay stubs for detailed work history reports.</p><p id="">Verifying your employment history not only aids in identifying any discrepancies but also gives you confidence in presenting accurate information to potential employers.&nbsp;</p><p id="">It's an essential part of conducting a comprehensive background check on yourself and crucial when seeking new career opportunities.</p><p id="">The key entities relevant to employment history verification include: The Work Number, wage and income transcript (from the IRS).</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Education History Verification</strong></h3><p id="">To verify your academic records and degrees, contact the institutions you've attended or use the National Student Clearinghouse online service for a fee.&nbsp;</p><p id="">This will help ensure that your education history is accurate and can be substantiated when undergoing pre-employment background checks.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Driving Records</strong></h3><p id="">Before transitioning to the topic of driving records, it's crucial to understand that education history verification is just one part of a comprehensive background check process.&nbsp;</p><p id="">When it comes to conducting pre-employment background checks, reviewing a candidate’s driving records is essential for evaluating their public safety data and driver’s license status.</p><p id="">This includes examining felony and misdemeanor convictions, moving violations, suspensions, restrictions, and class.</p><p id="">Conducting driving record checks provides insight into an individual’s motor vehicle-related infractions and offenses. It allows employers to make informed decisions regarding candidates whose roles may involve operating company vehicles or require a clean driving record as part of job requirements.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Credit History Review</strong></h3><p id="">After looking into your driving records, it's crucial to also review your credit history. Your credit report shows your borrowing and repayment habits.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Leveraging keywords from the list provided, a comprehensive self-check ensures you uncover any potential fraudulent activities connected with your social security number or financial discrepancies that could affect background screening results.</p><p id="">Additionally, knowing where you stand with creditors is vital in understanding what a potential employer may discover during their screening processes.</p><p id="">Reviewing your credit report can shed light on any instances of identity theft that might impact employment screening results. Checking for irregularities such as unauthorized account openings is essential in ensuring accuracy.</p><p id="">By verifying this information, you can gain deeper insights into any identity-related discrepancies.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Do's and Don'ts of&nbsp; A Self Background Check</strong></p><ul id=""><li id="">Gather all necessary personal information before starting the background check.</li><li id="">Search court records meticulously to uncover any potential legal issues.</li><li id="">Review your credit report and verify its accuracy for a complete financial picture.</li><li id="">Scrutinize your online presence, including social media accounts, to ensure they reflect a professional image.</li><li id="">Confirm the accuracy of your educational and employment history for thorough verification.</li><li id="">Exercise caution when using background check services, ensuring they are reputable and compliant with regulations.</li></ul><h2 id=""><strong id="">Benefits of a Self Background Check</strong></h2><p id="">Running a self-background check can uncover identity theft, helping individuals rectify any errors before they impact job prospects.
