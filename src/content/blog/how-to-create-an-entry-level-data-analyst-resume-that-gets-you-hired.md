<p>If you&#39;re sending out resumes for entry level data analyst roles and getting only silence, the problem isn&#39;t you—it&#39;s your resume. A generic resume is a guaranteed way to get lost in the noise, especially for competitive remote jobs where hundreds of candidates are all vying for the same spot.</p><p>This guide provides step by step instructions to build a resume that gets past automated screeners and impresses hiring managers.</p><h2>Why Your Data Analyst Resume Is Being Ignored</h2><p>Feeling like your applications disappear into a black hole is a common experience for new analysts. You’ve learned SQL, wrestled with <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, and have a folder full of projects. So why aren’t you getting interviews?</p><p>The short answer is you’re up against two gatekeepers: the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and the busy hiring manager. Both are scanning for specific signals that a generic resume almost always misses.</p><p>First is the ATS, the software that acts as the initial filter. It scans your resume for keywords and phrases that match the job description. If your document has complex formatting or lacks the right terms, it gets rejected before a human ever sees it. It’s a tough filter—according to Jobscan, <strong>over 98% of Fortune 500 companies</strong> use an ATS, and up to 75% of resumes are rejected by them.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6937ec6b3c0ce3c7a9cc28af_entry-level-data-analyst-resume-ats-funnel.jpeg" alt="ATS funnel processing resumes, with a large stack of documents piled up and some papers scattered." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>The Human Element</h3><p>Let&#39;s say you make it past the software. Now you have to impress a real person who is likely drowning in applications. Recruiters spend just a few seconds on their initial scan to decide if your resume is worth a closer look. They are not just looking for a list of skills; they are hunting for proof that you can use data to solve real business problems.</p><p>This is where a generic <code>entry level data analyst resume</code> completely falls apart. It might say &quot;SQL&quot; and &quot;Python,&quot; but it fails to show how you <em>used</em> those skills to create something of value. And that&#39;s the gap you must close.</p><blockquote><p>Your resume’s job is not just to list what you know. Its job is to prove how you can create value for a company. A powerful resume tells a story of problems solved and impact delivered, even if the experience comes from academic projects or internships.</p></blockquote><p>To see the difference, let’s break down the two approaches.</p><h3>Generic Resume vs Targeted Resume Breakdown</h3><p>Here is a quick comparison showing why a targeted resume gets interviews while a generic one gets ignored.</p><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 20px;"><thead><tr><th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">Resume Component</th><th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">Generic Approach (Gets Ignored)</th><th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">Targeted Approach (Gets Hired)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Headline/Summary</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">&quot;Entry Level Data Analyst seeking an opportunity.&quot;</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">&quot;Data Analyst with project experience in Python, SQL, and Tableau, focused on optimizing user retention.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Experience Bullet</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">&quot;Used SQL to query databases.&quot;</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">&quot;Wrote SQL queries to analyze customer behavior data, identifying a key drop off point that led to a 10% increase in trial conversions.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Skills Section</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">A long, unorganized list of every tool ever touched.</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">A curated list of skills that directly match the job description, with proficiency levels noted.</td></tr><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Overall Strategy</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">One resume sent to 100 different companies.</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">A unique resume tailored for each specific job application, mirroring the company&#39;s language and needs.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The takeaway is clear: sending a generic resume is like using a key that does not fit the lock. It is fast, but it is never going to open the door.</p><p>A targeted resume, on the other hand, does not just get past the ATS—it gives the hiring manager a compelling reason to call you. It shows you are a proactive problem solver who actually read the job description and understands what the team needs. This is critical when a recruiter is only giving your resume a quick glance, something we cover in our guide on <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/the-6-second-rule-why-your-resume-gets-skipped">why your resume gets skipped in just six seconds</a>.</p><p>The rest of this guide will show you exactly how to build a resume that gets noticed.</p><h2>Crafting Your Professional Summary and Contact Details</h2><p>The top of your resume is the most valuable real estate you have. Think of it as the storefront for your professional brand. A hiring manager’s eyes land here first, giving you one shot to make an immediate, powerful impression.</p><p>This is where you anchor your identity as a data professional. It needs to be clean, scannable, and give a recruiter everything they need to move forward. More importantly, it has to look professional and be optimized for both human readers and the Applicant Tracking Systems that screen it first.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6937ec6b3c0ce3c7a9cc28ac_entry-level-data-analyst-resume-resume-document.jpeg" alt="A partially visible resume document with the &#39;RESUME&#39; title and placeholder text, tilted on a pink background." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>Optimizing Your Contact Information</h3><p>Your contact details should be more than just a way to reach you; they are proof of your digital presence and technical credibility. Make sure this section is flawless and includes links that add real value.</p><ul><li><strong>Professional Email:</strong> Keep it simple and clean. An address like <code>firstname.lastname@email.com</code> is the standard. Avoid any unprofessional handles.</li><li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> Your primary mobile number is perfect.</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> For remote roles, listing &quot;Remote&quot; or just your &quot;City, State&quot; is all you need. Do not include your full street address.</li><li><strong>LinkedIn URL:</strong> This is non negotiable. Customize your LinkedIn URL to look professional (e.g., <code>linkedin.com/in/yourname</code>). It signals that you are serious about your career and gives them a deeper look at your network.</li><li><strong>GitHub Profile:</strong> For any data analyst, a GitHub link is a huge plus. It provides tangible evidence of your coding skills and project work, letting recruiters see your SQL scripts, Python notebooks, or other technical contributions.</li></ul><h3>Replace the Objective with a Powerful Summary</h3><p>Years ago, job seekers used a &quot;resume objective&quot; to explain what they wanted from a company. That approach is outdated. Today, companies want to know what you can do for <em>them</em>. That’s why you need a <strong>professional summary</strong>.</p><p>A professional summary is a short, 3 to 4 sentence paragraph sitting right below your contact info. It’s your elevator pitch, telling the recruiter exactly who you are, what skills you bring, and the value you offer. For an entry level data analyst, this is your chance to connect your skills directly to business needs.</p><blockquote><p>Your professional summary is your headline. It should be so compelling that it makes the hiring manager want to read the rest of your story. Focus on your top 2-3 technical skills, mention a key project, and state your career focus.</p></blockquote><p>A strong summary is a game changer. We have a complete guide on <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/how-to-write-a-professional-summary-that-is-attention-grabbing">how to write a professional summary that is attention grabbing</a> that dives even deeper with more examples.</p><h3>Examples of Effective Professional Summaries</h3><p>Let&#39;s break down how to build this section based on different backgrounds. Notice how each example is specific, mentions technical tools, and highlights a real outcome.</p><p><strong>For a Recent Graduate:</strong></p><ul><li>&quot;Recent Data Analytics graduate with hands on experience in SQL, Python, and Tableau. Developed a comprehensive sales dashboard for a university project that visualized quarterly performance and identified a <strong>15%</strong> variance in regional sales targets. Eager to apply analytical and data visualization skills to drive business insights in a remote data analyst role.&quot;</li></ul><p><strong>For a Career Changer (from Marketing):</strong></p><ul><li>&quot;Marketing professional transitioning into data analytics, proficient in SQL, Power BI, and Google Analytics. Leveraged data analysis to optimize digital ad campaigns, resulting in a <strong>20%</strong> increase in click through rates. Seeking to combine marketing domain knowledge with newly acquired technical skills to support data driven decision making in a remote analyst position.&quot;</li></ul><p>These summaries work because they are packed with relevant keywords and speak directly to an employer&#39;s needs. They are short, impactful, and set a confident tone for the rest of your resume.</p><h2>Building a Skill Section That Beats the ATS</h2><p>Your skills section is the engine of your resume. For an entry level data analyst, this is where Applicant Tracking Systems do most of their work, scanning for keywords that match the job description. A messy, disorganized list gets you screened out. A strategic one puts you at the top of the pile.</p><p>Think of this section as your keyword arsenal. It needs to be instantly scannable for a recruiter&#39;s six second glance and perfectly optimized for the ATS.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6937ec6b3c0ce3c7a9cc28b5_entry-level-data-analyst-resume-skills-list.jpeg" alt="Hand-drawn diagram listing technical skills, data visualization, and databases with corresponding playful icons." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>Categorize Your Skills for Clarity</h3><p>Do not just throw all your skills into one giant paragraph. That is a massive red flag for both recruiters and the ATS. Instead, break them down into logical categories. This simple move shows you understand the different facets of a data analyst role and makes it easy for a hiring manager to find what they are looking for.</p><p>Create clear subheadings that reflect the core functions of the job. This small step makes your resume feel professional and significantly easier to scan.</p><p><strong>Common Skill Categories for Data Analysts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> This is your core toolbox. It includes programming languages and essential analytical software.</li><li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> This highlights your ability to turn raw data into a compelling story.</li><li><strong>Databases:</strong> This proves you know how to work with the systems that store the data.</li><li><strong>Other Tools:</strong> A catch all for other relevant software, like cloud platforms or project management tools you have used.</li></ul><h3>What Keywords and Skills to Include</h3><p>Now it is time to populate those categories with the right keywords. The best place to find them is straight from the job descriptions of roles you are interested in. Pay attention to which tools and technologies appear over and over again. Those are your non negotiables.</p><blockquote><p>Listing a skill is only half the battle. You have to be prepared to prove your proficiency. For every skill you list here, you need a corresponding example in your projects or experience section that shows how you used it.</p></blockquote><p>Here are some of the most in demand skills for entry level data analyst roles right now.</p><p><strong>Technical Skills</strong></p><ul><li><strong>SQL:</strong> (PostgreSQL, MySQL, T-SQL) Your ability to query and manage data is fundamental. Non negotiable.</li><li><strong>Python:</strong> (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) Essential for data cleaning, analysis, and automating tasks.</li><li><strong>R:</strong> (ggplot2, dplyr) Still widely used, especially in statistical analysis and more academic roles.</li><li><strong>Microsoft Excel:</strong> (PivotTables, VLOOKUP, Power Query) Do not underestimate it. Excel is still a powerhouse for many business analysis tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>Data Visualization</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a></li><li><a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Power BI</a></li><li><a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/">Looker Studio</a> (formerly Google Data Studio)</li><li>Seaborn/Matplotlib (Python libraries)</li></ul><p>Mastering these skills does not just make your resume look good—it directly impacts your earning potential. The analyst market is competitive, and in demand technical skills are a huge factor in compensation. You can learn more by checking out this guide to entry-level data analyst salary negotiation.</p><h3>Backing Up Your Skills with Proof</h3><p>Remember, your skills section makes a promise that the rest of your resume must keep. If you list <strong>&quot;SQL,&quot;</strong> your projects section better have a bullet point detailing a complex query you wrote to uncover an insight. If you list <strong>&quot;Tableau,&quot;</strong> there should be a link to your Tableau Public profile or a project where you built an interactive dashboard.</p><p>This direct connection between your skills and your experience is what separates a weak resume from a strong one. It shows you have actively applied these tools to solve real problems. That is the evidence that convinces a hiring manager you are ready for the job. Using an ATS-friendly resume builder, like the free tool from Jobsolv, helps ensure your formatting is clean and your keywords are ready for review.</p><h2>Turning Projects and Experience into Achievements</h2><p>This is where your resume stops being a list of things you did and starts telling a story about the value you create. Hiring managers are not just looking for someone who knows SQL; they are looking for someone who can <em>use</em> SQL to solve a business problem. Even if you do not have a formal job title, your projects and academic work are packed with achievements—you just need to frame them correctly.</p><p>The trick is to shift from describing a task to explaining its impact. Every bullet point on your resume needs to answer the recruiter&#39;s silent question: &quot;So what? Why should I care?&quot;</p><h3>Frame Everything with the PAR Method</h3><p>One of the simplest and most effective frameworks for this is the <strong>Problem, Action, Result (PAR)</strong> method. It forces you to connect your technical skills to a real outcome, which is precisely what gets an employer’s attention. It turns a boring task into a compelling mini story.</p><p>Here’s the breakdown:</p><ul><li><strong>Problem:</strong> What was the business challenge or question you were trying to answer?</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> What specific tools, skills, or techniques did you use to tackle it?</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> What was the measurable outcome? Think in numbers, percentages, efficiencies, or insights gained.</li></ul><p>Let’s put this into practice. This small shift is often the difference between a resume that gets ignored and one that lands you an interview for that remote data analyst job.</p><h3>Before and After Bullet Point Examples</h3><p>Transforming your experience is all about adding context and metrics. A weak bullet point just states a task. A strong one shows you know how to create value.</p><p><strong>Example 1: Analyzing Sales Data</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Before:</strong> &quot;Analyzed sales data using SQL.&quot;</li></ul><p>This tells the recruiter almost nothing. It’s a passive statement that lists a skill but gives zero context on why it mattered.</p><ul><li><strong>After:</strong> &quot;Identified a <strong>15%</strong> sales dip in the electronics category by analyzing quarterly data with SQL, presenting findings in a Tableau dashboard that informed a new promotional strategy.&quot;</li></ul><p>See the difference? This version is a powerhouse. It states the <strong>problem</strong> (a sales dip), the <strong>action</strong> (SQL analysis and Tableau visualization), and the <strong>result</strong> (informed a new strategy). It proves you can connect data analysis to business decisions.</p><p><strong>Example 2: A University Project</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Before:</strong> &quot;Completed a project on customer churn.&quot;</li></ul><p>Again, this is too vague. It does not explain what you found or why anyone should care.</p><ul><li><strong>After:</strong> &quot;Developed a predictive model using Python with Pandas and Scikit learn to identify customers at high risk of churn, achieving <strong>85%</strong> accuracy and providing actionable segments for a targeted retention campaign.&quot;</li></ul><p>The &quot;after&quot; version is loaded with relevant keywords (Python, Pandas, Scikit learn) and a concrete, quantifiable achievement (<strong>85%</strong> accuracy). It demonstrates not just technical skill but also strategic thinking.</p><blockquote><p>Your goal is to show you are not just a student or a coder; you are a problem solver. Frame every project as a mini case study where you are the hero who used data to make a difference.</p></blockquote><h3>Quantify Your Impact Even Without Hard Numbers</h3><p>What if your project did not directly lead to a sales increase or cost savings? You can still quantify your impact. You just have to think differently—about efficiency, scale, or the scope of your work.</p><p>Here are a few ways to add numbers when the results are not obvious:</p><ul><li><strong>Scale of the Data:</strong> &quot;Cleaned and processed a dataset of over <strong>50,000</strong> customer records using Python and Pandas to prepare for analysis.&quot;</li><li><strong>Efficiency Gained:</strong> &quot;Automated a weekly reporting process using an SQL script, reducing the time required for data extraction by <strong>90%</strong>.&quot;</li><li><strong>Scope of the Project:</strong> &quot;Collaborated with a team of <strong>3</strong> to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that tracked <strong>5</strong> key performance indicators.&quot;</li></ul><p>These examples give concrete evidence of your capabilities and make your contributions feel more significant. Building this kind of narrative directly impacts your marketability. According to <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Data_Analyst/Salary">PayScale&#39;s research on data analyst salaries</a>, strong technical skills demonstrated through real impact are critical for salary growth, even at the entry level.</p><p>Jobsolv&#39;s free resume builder is designed to help you structure these achievement oriented bullet points effectively.<br>The tool guides you through creating sections that highlight your impact, making sure your resume is optimized to get past the ATS and impress a real person.</p><h2>How to Optimize Your Resume for ATS and Remote Jobs</h2><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0jQwXfsOds4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div></div><p>Getting your resume past the first hurdle is a game of two audiences. First, you have to please the Applicant Tracking System. Only then does it land in front of a human recruiter.</p><p>This means your resume needs to be technically sound <em>and</em> compelling. It is a balancing act, especially when you are also trying to signal you are a perfect fit for a remote role.</p><p>Think of the ATS as a security guard with a specific guest list. Fancy designs, weird fonts, or complex tables will get you turned away. Sticking to a clean, single column layout with a standard font like Arial or Calibri is your safest bet. And always submit it as a PDF to preserve your formatting.</p><h3>Beating the Bots: A Technical Checklist</h3><p>Before you apply, give your resume a quick technical review. These small details are often the difference between getting seen and getting rejected by an algorithm.</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Formatting Only:</strong> Avoid columns, text boxes, and images. A single column layout is the gold standard for ATS parsers—it is clean, simple, and easy for the software to read.</li><li><strong>Use Standard Section Headers:</strong> Do not get creative here. Stick to universally recognized titles like &quot;Professional Summary,&quot; &quot;Skills,&quot; &quot;Experience,&quot; and &quot;Education.&quot; The ATS is programmed to look for these specific headings.</li><li><strong>Keyword Matching is Everything:</strong> The ATS scores your resume based on how well your language matches the job description. Your mission is to mirror the exact keywords and phrases used in the posting you are targeting.</li></ul><p>You can take the guesswork out of this with an ATS friendly tool. For a deeper dive, check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/12-best-ats-resume-checker-tools-for-data-professionals-in-2025">best ATS resume checker tools for data professionals</a>.</p><h3>Tailoring Your Resume for Each Remote Job</h3><p>Let’s be clear: sending the same generic resume to every opening is the fastest way to get ignored. The good news? Tailoring your resume for each application does not have to take hours. It is about being strategic.</p><p>Start by copying the entire job description into a word cloud generator or a blank document. Look for the technical skills (<strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Power BI</strong>) and soft skills (communication, self management, proactive) that appear most often. These are your target keywords.</p><p>Now, weave these exact phrases into your professional summary, skills section, and experience bullets. If the job description repeatedly mentions &quot;A/B testing,&quot; make sure that exact term appears in a project description where you performed it.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6937ec6b3c0ce3c7a9cc28b2_entry-level-data-analyst-resume-process-flow.jpeg" alt="Flowchart illustrating a problem-action-result process using lightbulb, gear, and trophy icons." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>Highlighting Your Remote Readiness</h3><p>For remote roles, hiring managers are looking for proof that you can thrive without constant supervision. They want self starters who are masters of communication. You need to signal these traits directly on your resume.</p><ul><li><strong>Communication Tools:</strong> Explicitly mention your experience with tools like <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>Asana</strong>, <strong>Trello</strong>, or <strong>Jira</strong>. This immediately shows you are fluent in the language of distributed teams.</li><li><strong>Self Management:</strong> Use action verbs that show autonomy. Think &quot;<strong>Independently managed</strong>,&quot; &quot;<strong>Initiated</strong>,&quot; or &quot;<strong>Led a project from concept to completion</strong>.&quot;</li><li><strong>Proactive Communication:</strong> Frame a bullet point specifically around how you communicate. For example: &quot;<strong>Presented findings to a remote team via scheduled video calls, ensuring all stakeholders were aligned on project progress.</strong>&quot;</li></ul><p>The rise of remote work has also leveled the playing field for compensation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for data professionals is expected to grow much faster than average. This demand allows analysts in lower cost of living areas to command salaries once reserved for major tech hubs. Proficiency in <strong>SQL</strong> or <strong>Python</strong> can add another <strong>15% to 25%</strong> to your offer.</p><h2>Answering Your Top Questions</h2><p>Stepping into the data analyst job market can feel overwhelming. Many questions come up, especially when you are just starting out. Let&#39;s tackle the most common ones to give you clarity and confidence.</p><h3>How Long Should an Entry-Level Resume Be?</h3><p>The answer is simple: <strong>one page</strong>.</p><p>Think about it from the hiring manager&#39;s perspective. They are sifting through hundreds of applications for a single remote role. They do not have time to read your life story. A one page resume forces you to be sharp and to the point. It is your first test in demonstrating a core analyst skill: summarizing complex information and highlighting what truly matters.</p><blockquote><p>Every line on your resume has to earn its spot. If a bullet point does not directly sell you for <em>that specific job</em>, remove it. Brevity shows you respect the recruiter&#39;s time and are confident in your value.</p></blockquote><h3>Do I Really Need to Write a Cover Letter?</h3><p>Yes. If the application gives you the option, you should write one. While not every hiring manager will read it, many do, and it is an opportunity you cannot afford to skip. A solid cover letter connects the dots between your resume and what the company is looking for.</p><p>Do not just rehash your resume. A great cover letter does three things your resume cannot:</p><ul><li><strong>Show genuine enthusiasm:</strong> Explain <em>why</em> you are excited about this specific company and this role.</li><li><strong>Tell a quick story:</strong> Briefly walk them through a project that shows off your problem solving skills in a way a bullet point never could.</li><li><strong>Explain your journey:</strong> If you are changing careers, this is the perfect place to frame your transition and show how your past experience is a strength.</li></ul><p>Keep it short, professional, and focused on the value you will bring to their team.</p><h3>What Kind of Projects Should I Put on My Resume?</h3><p>When you do not have much formal work experience, your projects section is everything. It is your proof. The best projects are the ones that show you have already been doing the job.</p><p>Do not just list a project title. Frame it using the Problem, Action, Result (PAR) model we discussed. Show the <em>why</em> behind your work.</p><p><strong>Project ideas that get a hiring manager&#39;s attention:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Sales Dashboard that Tells a Story:</strong> Grab a public dataset from a site like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> and build an interactive sales dashboard in <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> or <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power BI</a>. Do not just show data; analyze trends, pinpoint top selling products, and visualize regional performance.</li><li><strong>Customer Segmentation with a Purpose:</strong> Use <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to run a cluster analysis on a customer dataset. Go beyond identifying groups and suggest specific marketing strategies for each one.</li><li><strong>Web Scraping for Real Insights:</strong> Scrape data from a site—like real estate listings or product reviews—then clean it, analyze it, and present your findings. What drives home prices or review ratings?</li></ul><p>Showcase these on your GitHub. It is the most powerful way to give a hiring manager concrete evidence of what you can do.</p><h3>What About &quot;Entry-Level&quot; Jobs Asking for 2+ Years of Experience?</h3><p>You will see this often. An &quot;entry level&quot; posting that demands <strong>2 to 3 years of experience</strong>. Do not let it discourage you.</p><p>This is often a hiring manager&#39;s &quot;wish list,&quot; not a strict requirement. If you check most of the other boxes and feel your skills are a good match, you should still apply.</p><p>Your job is to make the case that your project work, internships, or academic experience are just as valuable as formal job experience. Frame your projects like professional achievements. A project where you managed a messy dataset, ran an analysis with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">SQL</a>, and built a dashboard in Power BI is a powerful display of your skills. It does not matter if you did it for a class or for a Fortune 500 company.</p><hr><p>Written by Jobsolv’s career team, experts in data &amp; analytics job search and resume optimization.
