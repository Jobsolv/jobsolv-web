A surprising fact: 94% of human resources managers expect to get a follow-up email in 24 hours. This will guide you on how to send an effective post-interview message that stands out.</p><p id="">Keep reading for expert tips.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Importance of Post-Interview Follow-Up</strong></h2><p id="">Sending a thank-you note quickly shows the hiring manager you're eager and respectful. HR managers agree that reaching out within 24 hours is good. This quick action keeps your name fresh in their mind.</p><p id="">It's a smart move in the <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog" id="">job hunting game</a>.</p><p id="">A well-crafted follow-up can make you stand out. It proves to employers you listened and are ready to jump into projects or solve problems.

This shows recruiters you're interested and keeps you fresh in their minds.</li><li id="">Avoid weekends and holidays. If your interview was on Friday, wait until Monday morning. People don't check work emails much during their free time.</li><li id="">Check for big company events.
