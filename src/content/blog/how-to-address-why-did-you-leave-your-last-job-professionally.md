They want to know if they can trust you. If they see that you leave jobs a lot, they might not hire you. They don’t want to waste time and money on someone who leaves quickly.</p><p id="">They also ask this question to learn about your work life. If you left for more money or growth, it shows them what motivates you. It tells them what kind of worker you are. Staying clear and honest helps the boss trust you more.</p><p id="">Lastly, bosses use this question to find out how much risk there is in hiring someone new. The truth from an old job can show problems that might come up later. A good answer will put their minds at ease and make them feel safe hiring the person.</p><blockquote id="">Key takeaway: <em id="">The question can feel like a minefield, but here's the deal: interviewers are just trying to get to know you.

Show you're stable even if you've had short gigs and highlight your commitment to finding the right fit. A genuine answer here can convince them you're the perfect addition to their team.</em></blockquote><h2 id="">Guidelines for Answering Professionally</h2><p id="">Be clear and concise in your response, avoiding any unnecessary details or rambling.</p><h3 id="">Be clear and concise</h3><p id="">You should always keep your answers as clear and short as possible.
