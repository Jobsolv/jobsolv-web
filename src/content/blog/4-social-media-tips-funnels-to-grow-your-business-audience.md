<p id="">Nowadays, remote jobs appeal to many job seekers because they offer greater flexibility, better work-life balance, and cost savings. As a result, the competition for remote jobs is stiff as more and more workers seek jobs offering these perks.&nbsp;</p><p id="">So, how can you convince hiring managers you're the right person for a remote role from a massive pool of other applicants? Here are nine things you can do to set yourself apart from other candidates.</p><h3 id="">1. Search for Jobs on Remote Job Platforms</h3><p id="">There are hundreds of job search websites online. While many of these sites post remote roles, they aren't ideal for remote job searches. If you want to compete favorably with other remote job seekers, narrow your job search to remote job search platforms.</p><p id="">Unlike general job search platforms, remote job search platforms only list remote jobs. You won't have to sift through hundreds of job listings that aren't for remote positions. Additionally, remote job search platforms have better remote job filters than regular job search platforms. As a result, they can make it faster and less of a hassle to find remote jobs tailored to your skills, experience, and preferences. </p><h3 id="">2. Highlight Your Remote Work Experience</h3><p id="">Recruiters are more likely to prioritize candidates with remote work experience. If you've held remote or hybrid roles, include them on your resume. You can tailor your resume by including words such as virtual or remote to ensure companies that use an applicant tracking system (ATS) pick up your resume.</p><p id="">Besides indicating your remote work experience on your resume, here are some other things you can include on it to showcase your remote work experience and get an edge over other candidates:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Familiarity with remote work tools: </strong>Remote workers usually use video conferencing, project management, and cloud-based tools to compensate for the lack of physical contact with team members. Include tools you're familiar with, such as Zoom, Google Meet, Asana, Slack, and Trello, to name but a few tools, and describe how you used them.</li><li id="">‍<strong id="">Ability to work independently: </strong>Remote work requires self-motivation. Highlight projects you completed independently with minimal or no supervision to demonstrate you're a self-starter.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Communication skills: </strong>Remote work requires strong communication skills since immediate face-to-face communication isn't possible when working remotely. Demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively via email, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools.</li></ul><p id="">Alternatively, consider including any side or freelance projects you've completed if you have no remote work experience. Doing so can demonstrate to potential employers that you can transition well into a remote role.</p><h3 id="">3. Build Your Online Presence</h3><p id="">Building and maintaining an online presence on a professional social media platform like LinkedIn can give you an edge over other candidates. For starters, here are some things you can do to optimize your LinkedIn profile:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Complete your profile: </strong>Recruiters often dismiss LinkedIn profiles without essential information. Fill in all the sections of your LinkedIn profile, such as headline, education, location, skills, and contact info, to name but a few sections.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Use a professional profile picture: </strong>First impressions matter, so you'll want to put your best face forward. Upload a professional headshot of yourself and consider using an online photo analyzer to assess whether your photo is appropriate.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Upload a background photo: </strong>Besides your profile picture, your background photo is another focal point on your LinkedIn profile page. Upload a background photo describing what you do concisely to stand out.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Use a personalized URL: </strong>When you create a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a554351/how-do-i-create-a-good-linkedin-profile-?lang=en" id=""><strong id="">LinkedIn profile</strong></a><strong id="">,</strong> LinkedIn creates a generic URL for your profile page. The generic URL typically consists of random letters and numbers. Create a personalized URL using your name to make it easier for recruiters to find your profile.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Engage: </strong>LinkedIn is more than just a platform where recruiters search for talent. It's also a social network for professionals. Post engaging content related to your field, leave thoughtful comments on other people's posts, and share captivating content that others post. Not only will doing so grow your network on LinkedIn, but it could also make potential recruiters take notice of your profile.</li></ul><p id="">Besides building your online presence on LinkedIn, consider creating a portfolio website to showcase your skills and projects you've completed. Doing so can set you apart from other applicants if you work in an industry like graphic design, web design, or photography, where visuals matter significantly to hiring managers.</p><h3 id="">4. Tap Your Networks</h3><p id="">While building an online presence can boost your chances of landing a remote position, don't ignore your personal networks. Inform your former colleagues, family, and friends you're looking for a remote role and provide them with your resume.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Referrals from people who know you and can vouch for you can help you get noticed among hiring managers viewing numerous faceless applications and boost your chances of securing a remote role.</p><h3 id="">5. Demonstrate Your Adaptability</h3><p id="">Remote companies typically consist of multicultural teams working across different time zones. Highlight your experience working with people from different cultures and demonstrate your willingness to adjust your working hours if necessary.</p><h3 id="">6. Prepare for Virtual Interviews</h3><p id="">Remote or virtual interviews have a lot in common with in-person interviews. While you won't meet the interviewers face-to-face, you still must prepare for interview questions, show up on time, and dress appropriately.</p><p id="">Besides these things, here are some other key things you should do before you go through a remote interview:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Choose a suitable space: </strong>Select an appropriate room in your home that's quiet and free from distractions. Ideally, the space should have a neutral background (like a blank wall) to ensure the interviewers stay focused on you. Alternatively, if you don't have a clean background, consider using a virtual background of an office setting.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Check your lighting: </strong>Place your light source in front of your computer, not behind it. If your light source is behind you, it could cast a silhouette that could distract the interviewer. Also, consider using cool rather than warm light because it creates a brighter look.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Inform housemates: </strong>Notify your housemates about your virtual interview before your big day to ensure no one disrupts you during the interview.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Test your equipment: </strong>Test your webcam and the video conferencing tool the company uses to conduct interviews before the big day. Ensure your webcam drivers are current and you're running the latest version of the video conferencing software. Additionally, check the stability of your internet connection, as a bad internet connection could result in lag that interrupts the interview. You can check its stability using an internet speed test tool.</li></ul><p id="">Finally, consider conducting a mock interview with a friend or colleague. They can provide feedback about your body language, tone, facial expressions, and responses, allowing you to gain insights into things you can improve.</p><h3 id="">7. Follow Up On Your Application</h3><p id="">The days after an interview can be nerve-racking because they can put you in limbo. If you don't hear from the hiring manager two weeks after the interview, consider sending a follow-up email inquiring about the status of your application and expressing your interest in the position.&nbsp;</p><p id="">While sending a follow-up email won't guarantee getting hired, it could slightly boost your odds because it could show your genuine interest in the remote role.</p><h3 id="">Pros and Cons of Remote Roles</h3><p id="">Remote jobs offer several upsides, but is a remote role suitable for you? Before you send out applications for remote roles, let's explore some of the pros and cons of remote roles.</p><h4 id="">Pros of Remote Jobs</h4><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Flexibility: </strong>While some remote roles require employees to clock in and out at regular times, many remote roles offer a flexible work schedule. With a flexible work schedule, you can determine the hours when you want to work.&nbsp;<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Cost-savings: </strong>A remote role can save your costs on transportation, food, and other office-related expenses.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Better work-life balance: </strong>A remote role can allow you to balance your professional and personal life better. For instance, if you have children, a remote position can allow you to spend more time with them.&nbsp;<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Increased productivity: </strong>In a remote role, you won't have colleagues stop by your desk to interrupt your work because they want to share the latest office gossip. You can focus on your work without distractions.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Time-savings: </strong>Commuting to and from work can be time-consuming. Working from home can allow you to begin and end your work day on time.</li></ul><h4 id="">Cons of Remote Jobs</h4><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Loneliness: </strong>Working from home can be lonely, as you won't have the same face-to-face interactions with colleagues as in a traditional office setting.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Demotivation: </strong>If you require direct supervision and a rigid structure to get work done, remote work may demotivate you and reduce your productivity.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Overworking: </strong>Working from home may blur the lines between your personal and professional life. If you don't separate the two, you may find that you don't clock out and overwork, which could potentially cause burnout.<strong id="">‍</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Distractions: </strong>Working from home can be distracting if you live in a busy household.</li></ul><h2 id="">Simplify Your Remote Job Search</h2><p id="">Applying for remote roles can be daunting because of the competitive job market.
