<p>If you have ever applied for a remote data analytics job and heard nothing back, you probably were not rejected by a human. You were likely filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System, or ATS. These systems scan every resume for specific keywords, skills, and formatting before a hiring manager ever sees it. For data and analytics professionals, this means your expertise in Python, SQL, and Tableau might go unnoticed if your resume is not structured for a machine.</p><p>According to a Capterra survey, 75% of recruiters use an ATS to manage applications, making it the first hurdle in your job search. Your resume must be more than a summary of your experience. It needs to be a strategically formatted document designed to pass an automated screening. Failing to optimize for these systems is a common reason highly qualified candidates are overlooked. For a deeper dive into strategies that ensure your application stands out, read more on <a href="https://remotefirstjobs.com/blog/resume-for-remote-jobs">crafting a winning resume for remote jobs that beats ATS</a>.</p><p>This guide provides a collection of <strong>ATS friendly resume examples</strong> designed specifically for data roles, including data analyst, data scientist, and BI analyst. We will break down each example to show you exactly how to tailor your resume to pass the initial scan and highlight your most valuable skills. You will learn the formatting rules, keyword strategies, and practical steps to ensure your application lands in the &#39;yes&#39; pile. We will cover everything from downloadable templates to AI powered tools like Jobsolv that speed up the resume tailoring process.</p><h2>1. Data Analyst: The Keyword Alignment Masterpiece</h2><p>Data analysts must prove they can turn raw numbers into clear business stories. This example shows how to convert a standard resume into a powerful, keyword rich document that speaks directly to an ATS and hiring managers for top remote data analyst jobs. We will move from a &quot;before&quot; version that simply lists tools to an &quot;after&quot; version that showcases impact and aligns with job description language.</p><p>The core strategy here is <strong>keyword mapping</strong>. This involves identifying key terms from job postings and embedding them naturally into your resume&#39;s bullet points. We will demonstrate this using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to frame your achievements with clear metrics. This is one of the most effective <strong>ATS friendly resume examples</strong> because it helps you think like the screening software.</p><h3>Before: The Generic Skills List</h3><p>The original resume might have a bullet point like this:</p><ul><li>Created reports using SQL and Excel.</li></ul><p>While factual, this statement lacks impact. It tells a recruiter what you did but fails to explain the value you created or the specific technical skills you applied. It is easily overlooked by an ATS scanning for more descriptive phrases.</p><h3>After: The ATS Optimized Achievement</h3><p>The optimized version transforms that simple statement into a compelling, metric driven achievement:</p><ul><li><strong>Developed and automated 15+ weekly performance dashboards</strong> using Power BI and DAX, reducing reporting time by 8 hours per week and providing stakeholders with real time KPI tracking.</li></ul><p><strong>Strategic Breakdown:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Action Verbs:</strong> &quot;Developed&quot; and &quot;automated&quot; are stronger and more specific than &quot;created.&quot;</li><li><strong>Keyword Integration:</strong> It includes high value keywords like &quot;dashboards,&quot; &quot;Power BI,&quot; and &quot;DAX&quot; that an ATS is programmed to find.</li><li><strong>Quantifiable Results:</strong> The metrics &quot;15+ dashboards,&quot; &quot;8 hours per week,&quot; and &quot;real time KPI tracking&quot; demonstrate tangible business impact. This is crucial for passing both the ATS and human review stages.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The goal is not just to list your skills but to frame them within the context of achievement. Instead of saying you know SQL, show how you used ‘SQL query optimization’ to improve data retrieval times. Instead of mentioning Tableau, describe how you built ‘interactive dashboards’ that drove a specific business decision.</p></blockquote><p>This meticulous approach ensures your resume does not just get past the initial scan; it tells a compelling story of your value.</p><p><a href="#">Download the ATS-Friendly Data Analyst Template</a></p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Jobsolv’s AI resume tailoring feature automates this entire keyword mapping process. It scans your resume against a specific job description, identifies missing keywords, and suggests optimized bullet points in seconds, ensuring you achieve perfect alignment without the manual effort.</p><h2>2. Jobscan: The ATS Match Rate Specialist</h2><p>Jobscan is a platform built to help your resume beat the bots. While other tools offer general resume building, Jobscan specializes in the technical side of ATS optimization. It directly compares your resume to a specific job description, providing a &quot;match rate&quot; and a detailed report for improvement. This makes it a crucial tool for anyone serious about getting past the initial automated screening phase.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6919768de2965dd4f89a183b_3da61fbb-ee8d-49a7-8d0d-59a51b9f39f2.jpeg" alt="Jobscan" / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><p>The platform&#39;s strength lies in its diagnostic approach. Instead of just giving you a template, it teaches you <em>how</em> to think like an ATS. By highlighting missing keywords, mismatched skills, and formatting issues, it turns the screening process into a transparent, step by step process. This makes it one of the most powerful resources for creating <strong>ATS friendly resume examples</strong> tailored to each application.</p><h3>The Diagnostic Power: From Guesswork to Data Driven</h3><p>A common mistake is submitting the same resume for multiple roles. Let&#39;s see how Jobscan pinpoints why that fails.</p><p><strong>The Scenario:</strong> You apply for a Business Intelligence Analyst role with a resume heavy on &quot;data analysis&quot; and &quot;reporting.&quot; The job description, however, emphasizes &quot;data visualization,&quot; &quot;stakeholder management,&quot; and &quot;ETL processes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jobscan&#39;s Analysis:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Low Match Rate:</strong> Your resume scores a 45% match because it lacks the specific terminology the employer&#39;s ATS is searching for.</li><li><strong>Keyword Gaps:</strong> The scan reveals you are missing high priority keywords like &quot;Tableau Dashboards,&quot; &quot;Power BI,&quot; &quot;SSIS,&quot; and &quot;stakeholder communication.&quot;</li><li><strong>Skills Mismatch:</strong> It flags that while you listed &quot;SQL,&quot; the job description specified &quot;T-SQL&quot; and &quot;query optimization,&quot; which are more precise and valuable terms.</li></ul><h3>The Optimization: Closing the Keyword Gaps</h3><p>Armed with this data, you can now make specific edits to your resume, transforming it into a high match document.</p><p><strong>The Action:</strong></p><ul><li>You revise a bullet point from &quot;Used SQL to pull data for reports&quot; to &quot;<strong>Optimized T-SQL queries</strong> to build and maintain <strong>ETL processes</strong> with <strong>SSIS</strong>, improving data pipeline efficiency by 20%.&quot;</li><li>You add another bullet: &quot;Developed interactive <strong>Tableau Dashboards</strong> to track sales KPIs, enabling effective <strong>stakeholder communication</strong> and data driven decision making.&quot;</li></ul><p><strong>Strategic Breakdown:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Targeted Keywords:</strong> You have now embedded the exact high value keywords (&quot;T-SQL,&quot; &quot;ETL processes,&quot; &quot;SSIS,&quot; &quot;Tableau Dashboards,&quot; &quot;stakeholder communication&quot;) that the ATS is programmed to find.</li><li><strong>Contextual Evidence:</strong> The keywords are not just listed; they are integrated into achievement oriented statements that show your impact.</li><li><strong>Rescan and Verify:</strong> After making changes, you can rescan your resume against the same job description to see your match rate climb, confirming your edits were effective before you hit &quot;apply.&quot;</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Jobscan&#39;s value is in its precision. It moves you from a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to a highly targeted, data backed strategy for every single job application, dramatically increasing your chances of landing an interview.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Jobscan’s scanner is a perfect diagnostic tool, but the manual editing process can be slow. Jobsolv&#39;s automated resume tailoring can apply these same principles in seconds. It identifies keyword gaps and instantly generates optimized bullet points, giving you the benefit of a high match score without the time consuming rewrite.</p><h2>3. Microsoft Create (ATS resume templates)</h2><p>Microsoft Create provides a reliable starting point for anyone building a resume from scratch. It offers a vast library of free, professionally designed resume templates directly within Microsoft Word. This makes it an accessible tool for creating a clean, well formatted document that follows the basic rules of Applicant Tracking Systems. We will look at how to use these templates as a foundation and the manual steps required to make them truly powerful.</p><p>The core advantage here is <strong>trusted formatting</strong>. These templates are built by Microsoft, ensuring they are compatible and render correctly. This helps you avoid common parsing errors that affect resumes made with less standard tools. We will show how to take a standard Microsoft template and manually add keyword density and achievement oriented language to pass ATS scans and impress recruiters. This approach highlights how a good template is just the beginning of crafting one of the best <strong>ATS friendly resume examples</strong>.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6919768ce2965dd4f89a1808_cd4e615c-1316-4525-8e5a-2e01764b5c60.jpeg" alt="Microsoft Create (ATS resume templates)" / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>Before: The Basic Template</h3><p>A user might download a clean, ATS friendly template from Microsoft Create and fill in their experience like this:</p><ul><li>Responsible for data analysis and reporting.</li></ul><p>This statement is passive and generic. While it fits neatly into the template&#39;s structure, it carries no weight and contains no specific keywords that an ATS would flag for a data analytics role. It is a missed opportunity to show value.</p><h3>After: The Strategically Enhanced Content</h3><p>Using the same template, the optimized version transforms the bullet point into a targeted, impactful statement:</p><ul><li><strong>Analyzed customer behavior data using SQL and Python</strong>, identifying key drivers of churn and presenting findings to leadership via Tableau dashboards.</li></ul><p><strong>Strategic Breakdown:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Action Verbs:</strong> &quot;Analyzed,&quot; &quot;identifying,&quot; and &quot;presenting&quot; are active and demonstrate initiative.</li><li><strong>Keyword Integration:</strong> The bullet point now includes essential technical keywords like &quot;SQL,&quot; &quot;Python,&quot; and &quot;Tableau dashboards,&quot; which are critical for data roles. It also includes functional keywords like &quot;customer behavior data&quot; and &quot;churn.&quot;</li><li><strong>Demonstrated Impact:</strong> While not quantified with a number here, it shows a clear process from analysis to communication (&quot;presenting findings to leadership&quot;), which implies influence and value.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Microsoft Create gives you a structurally sound, ATS safe canvas. Your job is to fill that canvas with content that is rich with keywords, action verbs, and clear achievements. The template handles the formatting so you can focus entirely on the quality and optimization of your content.</p></blockquote><p>This method proves that a free, accessible tool can be the foundation for a top tier resume, provided you perform the strategic content work yourself.</p><p><a href="https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/ats-resumes">Visit Microsoft Create for Free Templates</a></p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> While Microsoft templates provide an excellent format, they do not help with the content. You can download a Microsoft template and then use Jobsolv’s <strong>free ATS approved resume builder</strong> to help write and optimize your bullet points. This combines a trusted format with AI powered content optimization for a powerful result.</p><h2>4. Indeed Career Guide (Resume Samples)</h2><p>Indeed is more than just a job board. Its Career Guide section is a vast educational resource offering hundreds of free, up to date resume examples for nearly every job. This makes it an excellent starting point for understanding the structure and language that both recruiters and Applicant Tracking Systems expect for a specific role, from a BI Analyst to a Machine Learning Engineer. We will explore how to use their templates as a foundation for building a powerful resume.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6919768ce2965dd4f89a180d_314768b4-9afb-4e26-bdde-f86979156811.jpeg" alt="Indeed Career Guide (Resume Samples)" / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><p>The primary strategy here is <strong>modeling and adaptation</strong>. Indeed’s examples provide a solid, recruiter vetted blueprint. Your task is to adapt this blueprint by adding your unique achievements and tailoring it with specific keywords from job descriptions. This is one of the most practical sources for <strong>ats friendly resume examples</strong> because it reflects what a major job platform knows its own systems and its users&#39; recruiters are looking for.</p><h3>Before: Using a Generic Template</h3><p>Downloading a template from Indeed without personalization might lead to a generic professional summary like this:</p><ul><li>Detail oriented Data Scientist with experience in machine learning and statistical analysis. Seeking to leverage analytical skills to contribute to a challenging role.</li></ul><p>This summary is passive and filled with clichés. It fails to communicate specific value or technical expertise, making it easy for an ATS or a human reviewer to dismiss.</p><h3>After: The Strategically Adapted Summary</h3><p>Using the template as a guide for structure, you can create a powerful, tailored summary:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience</strong> specializing in predictive modeling and natural language processing (NLP). Proven success in developing and deploying machine learning models that increased user engagement by 15% and reduced customer churn by 10%. Proficient in Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), SQL, and AWS SageMaker.</li></ul><p><strong>Strategic Breakdown:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Role Specific Keywords:</strong> The summary immediately includes high value terms like &quot;predictive modeling,&quot; &quot;natural language processing (NLP),&quot; and specific tools like &quot;AWS SageMaker.&quot;</li><li><strong>Quantifiable Impact:</strong> Metrics such as &quot;increased user engagement by 15%&quot; and &quot;reduced customer churn by 10%&quot; offer concrete proof of your capabilities.</li><li><strong>Credibility:</strong> The phrase &quot;5+ years of experience&quot; establishes your expertise level right away, helping you pass initial screening filters. This is crucial for understanding <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/why-resume-keywords-for-ats-matter-more-than-ever">why resume keywords for ATS matter more than ever</a>.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Treat Indeed’s examples as a structural guide, not a final product. Use their recommended sections and flow, but replace the generic content with your own metric driven accomplishments and keywords pulled directly from the job descriptions you are targeting.</p></blockquote><p>This method combines a trusted, ATS friendly format with the personalized detail needed to stand out.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> While Indeed offers the blueprint, Jobsolv’s AI resume builder helps you fill it in. You can start with a clean, ATS approved template and then use the AI tailoring tool to automatically generate optimized bullet points and keywords, ensuring your resume is both well structured and perfectly aligned with the job you want.</p><h2>5. Resume.io: The ATS Template Specialist</h2><p>Resume.io is a popular online resume builder known for its polished interface and a dedicated collection of templates designed specifically for Applicant Tracking Systems. It simplifies the creation process, offering pre written phrases and in app tips, making it a strong choice for professionals who need a professional looking, ATS compliant document quickly. The platform is particularly useful for those who want to avoid the complexities of formatting in a word processor.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6919768ce2965dd4f89a1812_76ca055f-76b3-436b-b1e1-d1209c20a4a3.jpeg" alt="Resume.io" / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><p>The core strategy with Resume.io is to use its <strong>pre vetted ATS templates</strong> while ensuring your content remains keyword rich and achievement oriented. Their builder guides you through each section, but it is still your responsibility to fill it with impactful language that mirrors job descriptions. This tool provides the clean, parsable structure an ATS needs, setting the stage for your powerful content to shine.</p><h3>Key Features for ATS Optimization</h3><p>Resume.io&#39;s strength lies in its user friendly features that guide you toward an ATS safe document.</p><ul><li><strong>ATS Template Collection:</strong> The platform offers a specific category of templates designed with simple, single column layouts that are easily read by screening software.</li><li><strong>Multiple Export Formats:</strong> Paid plans allow you to download your resume as a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file. The DOCX format is valuable because many recruiters prefer it, and it maintains formatting while being highly ATS compatible.</li><li><strong>Guided Writing:</strong> The builder provides professionally written content examples you can adapt, which helps in framing your own experiences with strong action verbs and clear descriptions.</li></ul><h3>Pros and Cons</h3><p>While user friendly, it is important to understand the platform&#39;s limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Pros:</strong> The builder is fast and intuitive, with a low cost trial that unlocks all premium features, including PDF and DOCX downloads. The dedicated ATS template section removes the guesswork from choosing a safe design.</li><li><strong>Cons:</strong> The free plan is restrictive, only allowing a basic TXT file download, which strips all formatting. Some of the more creative, multi column templates outside the ATS collection can cause parsing errors and should be avoided for data and analytics roles.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Use Resume.io for its expertly designed ATS friendly templates and easy to use interface. Always select a template from their designated “ATS” category to ensure compatibility. Remember that while the template provides the foundation, you must still fill it with keyword aligned, metric driven achievements to be effective.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://resume.io/resume-templates/ats">Explore Resume.io’s ATS Templates</a></p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> After building your resume on Resume.io, use Jobsolv’s AI resume tailoring tool to supercharge it. Upload your downloaded DOCX file and paste a job description. Jobsolv will instantly analyze it for keyword gaps and suggest optimized bullet points, guaranteeing your new resume is perfectly aligned for the specific role you want.</p><h2>6. Zety: The Educational Resume Builder</h2><p>Zety is a popular online resume builder that pairs a user friendly editor with extensive educational content on creating ATS compliant documents. This platform is ideal for job seekers who want to learn the principles behind a great resume while building one at the same time. It offers a large gallery of templates and provides real time tips to guide you through the writing process.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6919768de2965dd4f89a1819_2732a639-cbbd-47a8-a362-809b8d23a603.jpeg" alt="Zety" / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><p>The core strategy Zety promotes is <strong>foundational ATS compliance</strong>. This means focusing on clean formatting, standard section headers, and the right file type before you even start adding keywords. Zety’s guides and checklists are excellent resources for understanding how to avoid common ATS pitfalls, like using tables or graphics that can confuse the software.</p><h3>Features &amp; User Experience</h3><p>Zety’s builder guides users step by step, offering writing prompts and pre written content snippets you can adapt. You can easily switch between different templates to see which design best presents your information. This flexibility helps you find a balance between visual appeal and ATS compatibility.</p><p>For those on a budget, Zety allows you to create your entire resume and download it as a plain text (.txt) file for free. While this format is universally ATS friendly, it lacks professional design. To download a fully formatted PDF or Word document, you need to sign up for a paid plan.</p><h3>Strategic Breakdown</h3><ul><li><strong>Educational Resources:</strong> Zety excels with its in depth articles, guides, and checklists explaining the dos and don&#39;ts of ATS resumes.</li><li><strong>Template Variety:</strong> The platform offers dozens of templates, but users must be careful to select single column, traditional layouts for the best ATS performance.</li><li><strong>User Friendly Interface:</strong> The builder is intuitive, making it simple to add, edit, and rearrange sections without any technical skills.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Zety is an excellent choice for learning the fundamentals of what makes a resume ATS friendly. Its combination of a guided builder and rich educational content empowers you to create a solid resume. However, always prioritize simple, single column templates to ensure your document parses correctly.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://zety.com">Visit Zety to Build Your Resume</a></p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> After building your resume on Zety, use Jobsolv’s free ATS resume scanner to check its compatibility. You can then use our AI tailoring tool to optimize your Zety resume with specific keywords for each job application, giving you the best of both worlds: a strong foundation and perfect job alignment.</p><h2>7. Etsy: The Budget Friendly Template Marketplace</h2><p>Etsy is an online marketplace known for handmade goods, but it&#39;s also a vast source for instantly downloadable, low cost resume templates. For data professionals seeking a quick and affordable design update, Etsy offers thousands of visually appealing templates, many marketed as &quot;ATS friendly&quot; and available in common DOCX or Google Docs formats. This makes it an accessible starting point for those who want a structured layout without building one from scratch.</p><p>The core appeal is the variety and low cost. You can find clean, modern designs for just a few dollars, often bundled with matching cover letter templates and writing guides. However, this platform requires careful vetting, as the &quot;ATS friendly&quot; label is not a guarantee. This is one of the more unique sources for <strong>ATS friendly resume examples</strong> because it puts you in control of a visually diverse, editable document.</p><h3>Before: Believing All Templates Are Equal</h3><p>A job seeker might download a visually impressive Etsy template featuring a two column layout, icons, and a progress bar for skills.</p><ul><li>The design uses text boxes for contact information and a sidebar for the skills section.</li></ul><p>This design looks great to the human eye but is a nightmare for an ATS. The software cannot parse multi column layouts correctly, ignores text inside graphics or text boxes, and reads the content out of order, jumbling your work history and skills.</p><h3>After: The Vetted and Verified Template</h3><p>The savvy job seeker selects a single column template and manually verifies its ATS compatibility.</p><ul><li><strong>Selected a clean, single column DOCX template</strong> and confirmed it used standard fonts (like Arial or Calibri) and no text boxes, graphics, or tables for formatting.</li></ul><p><strong>Strategic Breakdown:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Prioritize Parsing:</strong> A single column layout ensures an ATS reads your resume from top to bottom in the correct logical order.</li><li><strong>Content over Graphics:</strong> Removing icons, photos, and skill rating bars prevents the ATS from skipping over crucial information or misinterpreting the file.</li><li><strong>Plain Text Test:</strong> Before populating the template, the user copies all placeholder text and pastes it into a plain text editor (like Notepad) to ensure the content hierarchy remains logical. If it is jumbled, the template fails the ATS test.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Etsy provides a massive library of affordable starting points, but you are the quality control manager. Always prioritize structure over style. A template&#39;s true value lies in its ability to be read by a machine first and a human second. Vet every template by checking for columns, text boxes, and non standard fonts before you begin writing.</p></blockquote><p>This approach allows you to leverage the low cost and design variety of Etsy without falling into common ATS traps.</p><p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/ats_friendly_resume">Browse ATS Resume Templates on Etsy</a></p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> After choosing an Etsy template, use Jobsolv’s free resume builder to check its compatibility. You can transfer your content into the builder, which guarantees a perfectly parsed, ATS compliant format. This gives you the best of both worlds: a design you like and a structure you can trust.</p><h2>Top 7 ATS Friendly Resume Examples Comparison</h2><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><table style="width:100%;

The examples in this guide show a crucial truth: the best resume is not just a document, but a targeted marketing tool designed to navigate the Applicant Tracking System and capture a recruiter&#39;s attention. Moving beyond generic templates to a tailored, ATS optimized format is the single most effective step you can take in your job search.</p><p>We deconstructed the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; of resumes for data analysts, data scientists, and BI professionals. The transformation in each case hinged on a few core principles. Ditching complex layouts for clean, single column designs ensures machine readability. Weaving keywords from the job description into quantifiable, metric driven accomplishment statements proves your value and aligns you with the employer’s specific needs.</p><p>Remember, every application is a new opportunity. The days of sending one resume to hundreds of openings are over. Your goal is to create a compelling story for each role, showing not just what you did, but the impact you made. This is the essence of building <strong>ats friendly resume examples</strong> that get you hired faster.</p><h3>Your Action Plan for Success</h3><p>To turn this knowledge into interviews, focus on these immediate next steps. First, choose a clean, ATS friendly template as your foundation. Jobsolv&#39;s free ATS approved resume builder or the minimalist options on Microsoft Create provide a solid start. Avoid templates with tables, columns, or excessive graphics that can confuse parsing software.</p><p>Next, audit your current resume against the job descriptions of roles you want. Use a tool like Jobscan for a keyword analysis or manually highlight the critical skills and qualifications the employer emphasizes. Integrate these terms naturally into your bullet points, focusing on achievements. For instance, instead of saying you &quot;worked with Tableau,&quot; specify that you &quot;developed interactive Tableau dashboards that reduced reporting time by 20%.&quot;</p><p>As you refine your professional brand, remember that your resume is just one piece of the puzzle. A polished online presence is equally important for making a strong first impression. You might consider modern tools to enhance your digital footprint, such as creating professional <a href="https://secta.ai/blog/p/ai-generated-headshots-for-linkedin">AI Generated Headshots for LinkedIn</a> to ensure your profile looks as sharp as your resume.</p><p>Finally, establish a system for tailoring your resume. For every remote data job you target, create a unique version. This may sound time consuming, but it is the key differentiator that gets your application moved from the &quot;no&quot; pile to the &quot;yes&quot; pile. By following the strategies outlined in our <strong>ats friendly resume examples</strong>, you are no longer just applying for jobs; you are strategically positioning yourself as the ideal candidate.</p><hr><p>Ready to stop guessing and start getting interviews? <strong>Jobsolv</strong>&#39;s platform automates the tedious work of tailoring your resume for every application. Use our free ATS approved resume builder, find your next remote data job on our board, and let our AI technology create perfectly optimized resumes in seconds, so you can focus on what matters: preparing to land the job.</p>
