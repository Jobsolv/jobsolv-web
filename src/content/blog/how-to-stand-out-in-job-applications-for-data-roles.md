<p>If you want to stand out in a crowded job market, you have to stop submitting generic applications. Instead, start telling a highly tailored, value driven story. This means building a resume that speaks to both Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and human recruiters, proving your impact with hard numbers, and using your network to get a referral.</p><h2>Why Your Application Strategy Matters More Than Ever</h2><p>In the data analytics job market, just having the right skills is not enough. Hiring managers are overwhelmed with applications, and your job is to make their decision to interview you an easy one. A smart strategy ensures your resume, portfolio, and professional brand all work together to tell a story about the value you create.</p><p>This guide is a practical playbook for data professionals looking for their next remote or hybrid role. We will break down exactly how to build an application that gets noticed.</p><p>To get started, here’s a quick look at the core strategies we will cover. Each one is a critical piece of the puzzle for landing a top tier data analytics role.</p><h3>Key Strategies for a Standout Application</h3><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 20px;"><thead><tr><th align="left">Strategy</th><th align="left">Why It Matters for Data Professionals</th><th align="left">Key Takeaway</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><strong>ATS &amp; Recruiter Optimization</strong></td><td align="left">Your technical skills mean nothing if your resume gets filtered out by software before a human ever sees it.</td><td align="left">Your resume must beat the bots <em>and</em> impress the hiring manager.</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>Quantifying Your Impact</strong></td><td align="left">&quot;Analyzed data&quot; is a task. &quot;Reduced data processing time by 30%&quot; is a result.

A project <em>shows</em> them.</td><td align="left">Prove your skills with tangible, real world examples.</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>Leveraging Your Network</strong></td><td align="left">A referral is the most effective way to get an interview.</td><td align="left">A warm introduction from a current employee makes you a priority candidate.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>These pillars form the foundation of a successful job search. Master them, and you will spend less time applying and more time interviewing.</p><h3>The Data Behind Modern Job Hunting</h3><p>The job market is a numbers game, and the odds are not in your favor if you only apply without a connection. According to LinkedIn, referred candidates are 4 times more likely to get hired.</p><p>The success rate for &quot;cold&quot; online applications is shockingly low, hovering between <strong>0.1% to 2%</strong>. This means you could send 100 applications and hear nothing back.</p><p>Now, compare that to candidates who get a referral. Their interview rate jumps significantly. The difference is staggering and highlights the power of building and using your network. If you are curious, you can learn more about these application success rates and what they mean for your search.</p><p>This visual tells the story better than words.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6927fc0634397722fe5e60ed_how-to-stand-out-in-job-applications-application-success.jpeg" alt="Infographic comparing job application success rates for cold applications versus referrals using progress bars." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><p>The data does not lie. While you will still need to submit online applications, the most effective path to your next role is through people. Building connections and getting referrals is the single best way to get ahead.</p><h2>Get Your Resume Past Robots and Into Human Hands</h2><p>Before a hiring manager ever sees your name, your resume faces its first hurdle: the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Think of it as a digital gatekeeper. It scans your application for specific keywords and qualifications to decide if you are a potential match. If your resume is not formatted correctly or lacks the right terms, it gets filtered out.</p><p>Your mission is to craft a single document that satisfies both the software and the person on the other side. This means striking a balance between clean, machine readable formatting and compelling, results driven language that grabs a recruiter’s attention.</p><h3>How to Structure Your Resume for Data Roles</h3><p>For data and analytics roles, the structure of your resume is non negotiable. You have to present your technical skills and business impact in a way that is immediately obvious. A messy or confusing layout can cause an ATS to scramble your information, getting you disqualified.</p><p>To make sure your resume gets parsed correctly, stick to these guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a Clean Template:</strong> Forget fancy designs with columns, tables, or excessive graphics. A simple, single column layout is best. Tools like <strong>Jobsolv’s free ATS approved resume builder</strong> are designed to create perfectly formatted documents that sail through automated screening.</li><li><strong>Stick to Standard Section Headings:</strong> Use conventional headings like “Professional Experience,” “Skills,” and “Education.” Trying to be clever with titles like “My Professional Journey” will only confuse the software.</li><li><strong>Align with Job Keywords:</strong> Read the job description carefully. Pinpoint the key skills and technologies mentioned, then weave those exact terms like “Python,” “SQL,” “Tableau,” or “Power BI” into your skills section and work experience.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> A well organized, keyword rich resume is your ticket past the ATS. The system is looking for direct matches to the job description, so mirroring the employer&#39;s language is essential.</p></blockquote><h3>The Great Debate: One Page or Two?</h3><p>Conventional wisdom has pushed the one page resume, but for data professionals with significant experience, that advice can be a mistake. You need room to break down complex projects, showcase your technical toolkit, and quantify your impact. Squeezing everything onto a single page often means cutting the very details that would impress a hiring manager.</p><p>Research shows that two page resumes can actually perform better. One study found that two page resumes achieved an interview success rate <strong>35% higher</strong> than their single page counterparts. Candidates with more detailed resumes get more callbacks, which shows that providing enough context matters. You can <a href="https://huntr.co/research/job-search-trends-q3-2025">read the full research on job search patterns</a> and see the numbers for yourself.</p><p>A second page gives you the space to tell a complete story. It lets you elaborate on projects where you used SQL to manage a massive dataset or built a predictive model in Python, providing the depth that technical hiring managers look for.</p><h3>Show, Don’t Just Tell, Your Technical Skills</h3><p>Simply listing your technical skills is not enough. You need to provide context that shows <em>how</em> you used those skills to solve real business problems. This approach proves you have both technical ability and a solid understanding of business goals.</p><p>Instead of a generic list, try organizing your skills to demonstrate depth and context.</p><p><strong>Example Skills Section:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Programming &amp; Databases:</strong> Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit learn), R, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)</li><li><strong>Data Visualization &amp; BI Tools:</strong> Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Matplotlib</li><li><strong>Cloud &amp; Big Data:</strong> AWS (S3, Redshift), Azure, Spark, Hadoop</li></ul><p>Even better, weave these skills directly into the bullet points under your work experience. This connects your abilities to tangible outcomes, which is exactly what recruiters want to see. For more specific examples, check out our guide on <strong><a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/7-ats-friendly-resume-examples-for-data-pros-in-2025">ATS-friendly resume examples for data pros</a></strong>.</p><h2>Translate Your Experience into Business Impact</h2><p>Hiring managers for data roles do not care that you “created dashboards in Tableau.” That’s a task. What they really want to know is the <em>result</em> of that dashboard. Did it save time? Uncover a million dollar opportunity? Streamline a broken process?</p><p>Every time a recruiter scans your resume, they are asking, “So what?” Your job is to answer that question. You need to draw a straight line from your skills in SQL, Python, or <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power BI</a> to tangible business outcomes like cost savings, revenue growth, or efficiency gains.</p><p>This is how you stop looking like a technician and start looking like a strategic partner.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6927fc0634397722fe5e60f1_how-to-stand-out-in-job-applications-ats-resume.jpeg" alt="A magnifying glass with &#39;ATS&#39; on it reviews a resume document, symbolizing Applicant Tracking System screening." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>From Task to Achievement</h3><p>The first step is a mental shift. Stop thinking about <em>what you did</em> and start focusing on <em>why it mattered</em>. Every bullet point on your resume is a small sales pitch, and it should close with an achievement, not a responsibility.</p><p>A simple formula to get this right is: <strong>Action Verb + Project + Result</strong>.</p><p>Here’s a classic example from data analysts.</p><ul><li><strong>Before (Task):</strong> &quot;Wrote SQL queries to analyze customer data.&quot;</li><li><strong>After (Impact):</strong> &quot;Developed complex SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, identifying a key segment that led to a <strong>10% increase</strong> in targeted marketing campaign conversions.&quot;</li></ul><p>The second version is a story. It proves you not only have technical skills but also the business sense to apply them where it counts.</p><h3>How to Find Your Impact Numbers</h3><p>Quantifying your work can feel difficult, especially if your last company did not track every metric. But you can almost always find or reasonably estimate the numbers that prove your value. The key is to be credible and prepared to explain your math.</p><p>Here are a few places to start digging:</p><ul><li><strong>Time Saved:</strong> Did you automate a report or streamline a data pipeline? Figure out the hours saved each week. For example: &quot;Automated a weekly reporting process using Python scripts, reducing manual effort by <strong>20 hours per month</strong> and eliminating data entry errors.&quot;</li><li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> Did your analysis help the company cut spending? Maybe you found waste in the supply chain or optimized an operational process. &quot;Analyzed supply chain data to identify shipping inefficiencies, contributing to a <strong>$50,000 annual reduction</strong> in logistics costs.&quot;</li><li><strong>Revenue Generated:</strong> If you can connect your work directly to sales or marketing wins, that is a huge advantage. &quot;Built a predictive model to identify at risk customers, which supported a retention campaign that preserved <strong>$250,000 in annual recurring revenue</strong>.&quot;</li><li><strong>Improved Accuracy or Efficiency:</strong> Did your dashboard lead to smarter, faster decisions? Did your data cleaning project make a forecast more reliable? &quot;Engineered a data cleansing pipeline that improved the accuracy of sales forecasting models by <strong>15%</strong>.&quot;</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you cannot find a hard number, using strong descriptive phrases like &quot;significantly improved,&quot; &quot;enhanced,&quot; or &quot;streamlined&quot; is still much better than just listing a task.</p></blockquote><p>Your resume is a marketing document, and you are the product. When you frame your experience around business impact, you give the hiring manager exactly what they need: concrete proof of your value. This is one of the most powerful ways <strong>how to stand out in job applications</strong> and convince them you will deliver results.</p><h2>Build a Portfolio That Proves Your Skills</h2><p>A quantified resume tells a great story, but a portfolio <em>shows</em> it. For data professionals, a portfolio is the ultimate proof of your skills. It is tangible evidence that you can take a complex project from a messy start to a clean finish, moving beyond what you claim on paper to what you can actually deliver.</p><p>A strong portfolio answers a hiring manager&#39;s technical questions before they even have to ask. It proves you can wrangle data with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"><strong>SQL</strong></a>, build insightful visualizations in <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/"><strong>Power BI</strong></a>, or develop predictive models in <a href="https://www.python.org/"><strong>Python</strong></a>. Think of it as your personal library of case studies, ready to go on demand.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6927fc0634397722fe5e60f4_how-to-stand-out-in-job-applications-boosting-growth.jpeg" alt="A person pushes a red chair, symbolizing effort to boost growth towards a &#39;TEDD 15%&#39; target." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>Choose Projects That Solve Business Problems</h3><p>The most effective portfolio projects are not just technical exercises; they solve a real business problem. Hiring managers are less interested in a generic dataset analysis than in how you frame a problem, pick your methods, and drive toward a solution that matters.</p><p>When you are picking projects, focus on ones that mirror real world business challenges. This approach instantly makes your skills feel more relevant to a potential employer.</p><ul><li><strong>For a Data Analyst Role:</strong> You could perform a customer segmentation analysis on a public ecommerce dataset to pinpoint high value customer groups.</li><li><strong>For a BI Developer Role:</strong> Try building an interactive sales performance dashboard using <a href="https://www.tableau.com/"><strong>Tableau</strong></a> or Power BI, complete with filters and drill downs for different regions and product lines.</li><li><strong>For a Data Scientist Role:</strong> A project focused on predicting customer churn with machine learning algorithms would be a powerful showcase of advanced skills.</li></ul><blockquote><p>By framing your work around business scenarios, you demonstrate not just technical ability but also commercial awareness. That combination is what really sets you apart.</p></blockquote><p>A well structured portfolio shows hiring managers you are ready to tackle their specific challenges. Here are a few ideas to get you started, mapped to the skills they demonstrate.</p><h3>Data Project Ideas for Your Portfolio</h3><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 20px;"><thead><tr><th align="left">Project Type</th><th align="left">Skills Demonstrated</th><th align="left">Example Scenario</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><strong>Sales Performance Dashboard</strong></td><td align="left">Data Visualization (Tableau/Power BI), KPI Tracking, Stakeholder Communication</td><td align="left">Build an interactive dashboard for a fictional retail company to track sales by region, product, and time period, allowing executives to spot trends quickly.</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>Customer Churn Prediction</strong></td><td align="left">Machine Learning (Python/R), Predictive Modeling, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering</td><td align="left">Use a telecom dataset to build a model that identifies customers at high risk of churning, explaining the key factors driving that risk.</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>A/B Test Analysis</strong></td><td align="left">Statistical Analysis, Experimentation, Business Acumen</td><td align="left">Analyze the results of a hypothetical website redesign A/B test to determine if the new version significantly improved user conversion rates.</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>Market Basket Analysis</strong></td><td align="left">Data Mining, Association Rules (Apriori algorithm), SQL</td><td align="left">Use transaction data from a grocery store to uncover which products are frequently bought together, providing insights for product placement and promotions.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>These projects do more than just list tools; they tell a story about how you think and solve problems, which is what employers are looking for.</p><h3>How to Structure Your Project Write Ups</h3><p>A great project is only half the battle; you also have to explain it clearly. Every project in your portfolio needs a concise write up that walks the reader through your process. A simple but highly effective structure is <strong>Problem, Process, and Outcome</strong>.</p><p>Your goal is to make your work understandable for both technical and non technical people. A hiring manager should be able to grasp the project&#39;s value in just a few minutes.</p><p><strong>Essential Components of a Project Description:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Start by clearly defining the business question you set out to answer. For example, &quot;A retail company needed to understand the key drivers of customer attrition to build a better retention strategy.&quot;</li><li><strong>The Process &amp; Tools:</strong> Briefly describe your methodology and the tools you used. This is where you mention specific SQL queries, Python libraries like Pandas or Scikit learn, or visualization techniques.</li><li><strong>The Outcome &amp; Insights:</strong> Finish with the results. What did you discover? What was the business impact? For instance, &quot;The analysis revealed that <strong>70% of churn</strong> happened within the first 90 days, leading to a recommendation for a new customer onboarding program.&quot;</li></ol><h3>Make Your Portfolio Easy to Find</h3><p>Once you have a few solid projects, host them somewhere professional and easy to access. A personal website, a dedicated portfolio platform, or even a well organized <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> profile works perfectly.</p><p>Make sure to link to your portfolio from your resume and LinkedIn profile. Place the link right in your contact section and consider referencing specific projects in your cover letter. This simple step invites hiring managers to dig deeper.</p><p>Beyond projects, including published articles can also strengthen your profile. If you have any, our guide on <strong><a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/how-to-put-publications-on-resume-a-guide-for-data-professionals">how to put publications on a resume</a></strong> provides clear steps. Ultimately, a portfolio transforms you from a candidate who <em>says</em> they can do the job to one who has already <em>proven</em> it.</p><h2>Use Networking to Get Ahead of the Competition</h2><p>The most effective way to stand out is often to skip the line entirely. While a sharp resume and a strong portfolio are non negotiable, sending them into the &quot;cold application&quot; pile is a tough game to win.</p><p>This is where networking and referrals become your secret weapon. A warm introduction from a trusted source puts you miles ahead of everyone else before the hiring manager even reads your resume.</p><p>For data professionals, this is not about awkwardly asking for a job. It is about building genuine connections in the industry. It is about learning from others, sharing what you know, and establishing a reputation. Over time, those relationships turn you from &quot;just another applicant&quot; into a recommended professional.</p><p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/6927fc0634397722fe5e60ea_how-to-stand-out-in-job-applications-project-selection.jpeg" alt="A web interface displaying a project selection page with three cards featuring creative icons and a &#39;Go Pnyrciet&#39; button." / loading="lazy" /></figure></p><h3>Building Your Professional Network on LinkedIn</h3><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> is your home base for this strategy. The goal is to connect with data professionals and hiring managers at companies you want to work for. But successful outreach is all about giving before you ask.</p><p>Start by identifying people in roles you aspire to or at companies on your target list. Before you connect, engage with their content. A thoughtful comment on a post about a new data visualization technique or a shared article on machine learning ethics shows you are paying attention and have genuine interest.</p><p>After you have engaged a couple of times, send a personalized connection request.</p><p><strong>A Simple Outreach Template:</strong></p><blockquote><p>&quot;Hi [Name], I&#39;ve been following your posts on [Topic] and really enjoyed your recent insights on the new Tableau update. I am a Data Analyst focused on [Your Specialty] and would love to connect and follow your work.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This approach is not transactional. It is based on professional respect.</p><h3>The Power of the Informational Interview</h3><p>Once you have made a connection, the informational interview is your next move. This is a short, informal chat where you ask for advice about their career, the company, or the industry. It is a learning opportunity, not a backdoor job interview.</p><p>This approach aligns with a major shift in the hiring world. The candidate journey is a huge focus for employers. In fact, <strong>76% of job seekers</strong> want to know how long an application will take before they start, and <strong>60% will abandon applications</strong> that are too long. This shows that companies value efficiency and clear communication, qualities you can demonstrate through professional, respectful outreach. You can see more on this in the <a href="https://www.resumly.ai/blog/how-many-jobs-should-i-apply-to-per-day">full research on application trends</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> An informational interview is a powerful, low pressure way to get on someone&#39;s radar, gain invaluable insights, and potentially hear about unadvertised roles.</p></blockquote><p>Requesting one is simple.</p><ul><li><strong>Be Specific and Respectful of Their Time:</strong> &quot;Would you have 15 minutes in the coming weeks to chat? I am hoping to learn more about your experience moving from data analytics into a BI leadership role.&quot;</li><li><strong>Come Prepared with Questions:</strong> Do not waste their time. Ask about their projects, the company culture, or the skills they find most valuable.</li><li><strong>Always Send a Thank You Note:</strong> A brief follow up email thanking them for their time and mentioning a key takeaway from your chat is non negotiable. It reinforces your professionalism.</li></ul><p>By building these relationships, you create a network of advocates. When a role opens up, you are not a stranger from a pile of resumes. You are that sharp data professional who had that insightful conversation a few weeks ago, making a referral feel natural.</p><h2>Scale Your Job Search with Smarter Tools</h2><p>Applying to jobs is a numbers game, but the quality of each application is what lands you an interview. Manually tailoring every resume for every role is a surefire path to burnout. So, how do you scale your efforts without sacrificing quality?</p><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kjfkoa15cNU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div></div><p>This is where you make technology work for you. Instead of spending hours tweaking bullet points, you can use smart tools to handle repetitive tasks. This frees you up to focus on what really matters: networking, deep research on top companies, and preparing for your interviews. It is all about creating a smarter, more effective job search system.</p><h3>Instant Resume Tailoring with AI</h3><p>Applicant Tracking Systems are ruthless gatekeepers. If your resume does not have the specific keywords from the job description, it will probably be rejected before a human ever sees it. This means tailoring is not just a nice to have; it is the price of entry.</p><p>This is exactly the problem tools like <strong>Jobsolv’s instant AI resume tailoring</strong> were built to solve. You upload your master resume once, provide a job description, and within seconds, it generates an optimized version. It hits all the right keywords and skills, making sure your resume aligns perfectly with what the ATS is programmed to look for.</p><blockquote><p>This is not about cheating the system. It is about efficiently getting past the robot screeners so a human can see the value you bring. You can apply to dozens of relevant jobs with highly customized resumes in the time it used to take to manually edit just one.</p></blockquote><h3>Find Better Roles on a Specialized Job Board</h3><p>General job boards like LinkedIn or Indeed can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. You sift through hundreds of irrelevant listings just to find one or two that might be a fit. That is a massive waste of your time. A specialized job board changes this dynamic.</p><p>When you use a platform that is focused on remote and hybrid data roles, every listing is already pre qualified. It cuts right through the noise.</p><ul><li><strong>Higher Relevance:</strong> You only see roles for Data Analysts, BI Developers, Data Scientists, and related positions.</li><li><strong>Less Competition:</strong> Niche boards tend to attract more serious, qualified candidates, filtering out the flood of mass applicants you see on bigger sites.</li><li><strong>Industry Focus:</strong> These platforms understand the nuances of the data world, leading to better job matches.</li></ul><p>For instance, the <strong>Jobsolv remote job board</strong> is curated specifically for data and analytics professionals. This tight focus means you spend your time applying to positions that are a genuine match for your skills, which can dramatically increase your response rate. And if you want to take it a step further, you can check out our guide on <strong><a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/how-to-use-ai-auto-apply-tools-to-autofill-job-applications">how to use AI auto apply tools</a></strong> to streamline the process.</p><p>By combining AI driven tailoring with a focused job search, you build a system that is both high volume and high quality. This is the modern way to stand out, get more interviews, and land your next remote data role faster.</p><h2>Common Questions from Data Professionals</h2><p>When you are deep in the application process, specific questions always pop up. As a data professional, you know the details matter. Here are straight answers to the hurdles you will likely face so you can handle each one with confidence.</p><h3>Should I Still Write a Cover Letter?</h3><p>Yes, but only if you make it count. A generic cover letter is far worse than no cover letter at all. Hiring managers can spot a template from a mile away, and it signals a lack of real interest.</p><p>Instead of rehashing your resume, use the space to tell a short story. Connect one of your unique skills directly to a specific need the company has. You could even reference a company value or a recent project of theirs that excited you. A short, personalized letter proves you have done your homework and are genuinely invested.</p><h3>How Should I Follow Up After Applying?</h3><p>Following up shows initiative, but timing and tone are everything. A good rule of thumb is to wait about <strong>five to seven business days</strong> after you submit. This gives the hiring team a realistic window to sort through applications.</p><p>When you do reach out, keep the email brief, professional, and polite.</p><ul><li>Reiterate your strong interest in the role.</li><li>Briefly mention a key qualification that makes you a great fit.</li><li>Thank them for their time and consideration.</li></ul><p>A simple, respectful check in is all it takes to keep your name top of mind. It makes a positive impression without being pushy.</p><h3>How Do I Handle Employment Gaps on My Resume?</h3><p>The best approach here is to be honest and proactive. Trying to hide a gap can look suspicious, but explaining it simply frames it as part of your professional journey.</p><p>The right place to address this is in your cover letter or during an interview, not on the resume itself. You can briefly explain the reason, whether it was for family, professional development, or personal projects. Always frame it in a positive light by highlighting what you gained during that time. For example, you could mention specific courses you took, freelance projects you completed, or new technical skills you mastered.</p><hr><p>Ready to stop spending hours tailoring resumes and start landing more interviews? <strong>Jobsolv</strong> uses AI to instantly optimize your resume for every data analytics job you apply for, ensuring you get past the ATS and into the hands of hiring managers. <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com">Create your free ATS approved resume today</a>.</p>
