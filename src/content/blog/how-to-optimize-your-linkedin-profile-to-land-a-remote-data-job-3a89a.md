<p>In the competitive world of remote data and analytics jobs, your LinkedIn profile is more than a digital resume. It is your career’s front door. Think of it as your personal brand headquarters and networking hub. It is often the very first impression a recruiter will have of you.</p><p>For data professionals, this space is critical. It is where you prove you can do more than run queries. It is where you show real business impact. A neglected profile makes you invisible to the people you want to attract. A sharp, optimized profile becomes a magnet for opportunity.</p><p>This guide will walk you through transforming every section of your profile into a powerful asset. We will cover everything from crafting magnetic headlines to strategically showcasing your projects. All of this is tailored to help you land the remote data job you are targeting.</p><h3>Your LinkedIn Is Your Most Powerful Career Tool</h3><p>A complete profile is non negotiable. It’s the baseline. Your LinkedIn profile functions a lot like <a href="https://hostmora.com/blog/online-cv-website/">creating an online CV website</a>, acting as your dynamic professional story.</p><p>The data does not lie. Adding a professional photo can get you <strong>14 times more views</strong>. Profiles with every section filled out see <strong>30% more weekly views</strong>. Recruiters see this too. According to LinkedIn, employees found through the platform are <strong>40% less likely to leave</strong> in the first six months, making a well put together candidate a safer bet.</p><p>This simple flow breaks down the foundational steps to boosting your profile&#39;s visibility and making an impact.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/694b779551ffe459351b0156_how-to-optimize-linkedin-profile-optimization-process.jpeg" alt="A three-step infographic illustrating the LinkedIn optimization process: Photo, Complete Profile, and Add Skills." loading="lazy" /></p><p>It all starts with the basics: a great photo, a complete profile, and a skill list that mirrors what recruiters search for. Get these right, and you are already ahead of the game.</p><p>To help you focus your efforts, here is a breakdown of the most critical sections for data professionals.</p><h3>Key LinkedIn Optimization Areas for Data Professionals</h3><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 20px;"><thead><tr><th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">Profile Section</th><th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">What to Focus On</th><th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">Quick Tip Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Headline</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">SEO keywords for your target role (e.g., Data Analyst, ML Engineer).</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">&quot;Data Analyst</td></tr><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>About Section</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">A compelling narrative of your skills, impact, and career goals.</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Start with your core value proposition, then list key technical skills and tools.</td></tr><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Experience</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Quantifiable achievements using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">&quot;Increased report generation efficiency by <strong>40%</strong> by automating SQL scripts.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Skills</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">At least 5 core technical skills that align with job descriptions.</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Pin your top 3 skills (e.g., Python, SQL, Power BI) to the top of the section.</td></tr><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;"><strong>Featured</strong></td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Links to your GitHub, portfolio, or key projects.</td><td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Add a visual thumbnail and a short, impactful description for each featured item.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This table is a strategic guide to ensure you are investing your time where it will make the biggest difference.</p><h3>Aligning Your Profile and Resume</h3><p>Consistency is key. Hiring managers almost always check your LinkedIn profile and your resume. Any inconsistencies can be a red flag. Your goal is a unified professional brand that tells the same powerful story everywhere.</p><p>Think of it this way: your resume is the formal pitch for a specific role. Your LinkedIn is the broader view of your entire career. They should complement each other.</p><p>Make sure your job titles, employment dates, and key achievements match. If you need more strategies, our guide on <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/how-to-utilize-linkedin-careers-in-your-job-search">how to utilize LinkedIn Careers in your job search</a> is a great place to start. A consistent narrative builds trust and reinforces your expertise.</p><h2>Craft a Headline and Summary That Stops Recruiters</h2><p>Your LinkedIn headline and summary are the first two things a recruiter sees. Think of them as your digital handshake and elevator pitch. In those first few seconds, a hiring manager decides whether to keep reading or move on. For data professionals, this is prime real estate to signal exactly what you bring to the table.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/694b779551ffe459351b014a_how-to-optimize-linkedin-profile-data-analyst.jpeg" alt="An illustration of a data analyst with a magnifying glass icon, showcasing skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau for a remote position." loading="lazy" /></p><p>This space is more than just your job title. It is an opportunity to pack in the keywords recruiters actively search for. It instantly shows you have the skills they need for their open remote roles.</p><h3>Write a Headline That Works for You</h3><p>Your headline is the most powerful piece of SEO on your profile. It follows you everywhere, from search results to the comments you leave. A generic title like &quot;Data Analyst at Company X&quot; is a missed opportunity. You need to build a headline that is both searchable and descriptive.</p><p>You have <strong>220 characters</strong> to make an impression. Use every one. A great formula combines your target role, key technologies, and a statement about your impact. This simple tweak helps you show up in more searches and tells recruiters what you do at a glance.</p><h4>Headline Formulas for Data Professionals</h4><p>Let&#39;s look at a few practical examples.</p><ul><li><strong>For the Data Analyst:</strong> &quot;Data Analyst | SQL, Python, Tableau | Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Business Insights&quot;</li><li><strong>For the BI Developer:</strong> &quot;Business Intelligence Developer | Power BI, DAX, Azure | Building Dashboards That Drive Strategic Decisions&quot;</li><li><strong>For the Machine Learning Engineer:</strong> &quot;Machine Learning Engineer | Python, TensorFlow, AWS | Specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP)&quot;</li></ul><p>Notice how each one includes the job title, specific hard skills, and a value proposition. That is how you optimize your LinkedIn profile to attract the right attention.</p><h3>Maximize Your About Section</h3><p>If your headline is the hook, your &quot;About&quot; section is where you tell your story. It is your chance to expand on your experience and career goals in your own voice. Avoid just listing skills. Instead, weave them into a narrative that showcases who you are as a professional. A well structured summary can make all the difference.</p><p>A powerful &quot;About&quot; section includes four key elements:</p><ol><li><strong>A Strong Opening:</strong> Start with a sentence that states your professional identity and what you are passionate about.</li><li><strong>Your Technical Toolkit:</strong> List your core technologies and tools. This makes it simple for recruiters to see if you are a match.</li><li><strong>Measurable Achievements:</strong> Highlight <strong>2–3 key accomplishments</strong> with real numbers. This is concrete proof of your impact.</li><li><strong>A Clear Call to Action:</strong> End by telling people what you are looking for and inviting them to connect.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Your summary should answer three questions for a recruiter: Who are you? What value do you bring? And why should they contact you? Make the answers clear and compelling.</p></blockquote><p>This structure turns a simple bio into a strategic career asset. For more guidance, our article on <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/how-to-write-a-professional-summary-that-is-attention-grabbing">how to write a professional summary that is attention grabbing</a> has more examples.</p><h4>Example Summary for a Data Analyst</h4><p>Here is a sample &quot;About&quot; section that brings these principles to life:</p><p>&quot;I am a results driven Data Analyst with a passion for uncovering the stories hidden within complex datasets. With over five years of experience in the e commerce sector, I specialize in turning data into actionable strategies that boost revenue and improve customer experience.</p><p><strong>My Technical Toolkit Includes:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Languages:</strong> SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), R</li><li><strong>Visualization Tools:</strong> Tableau, Power BI, Looker</li><li><strong>Databases:</strong> PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift</li><li><strong>Cloud Platforms:</strong> AWS (S3, EC2)</li></ul><p><strong>Key Career Achievements:</strong></p><ul><li>Developed and automated a suite of Tableau dashboards that reduced manual reporting time by <strong>20 hours per week</strong> and provided real time sales insights to leadership.</li><li>Conducted A/B testing analysis using Python, leading to a <strong>15% increase</strong> in user conversion rates for a key product feature.</li><li>Designed a customer segmentation model that improved marketing campaign ROI by <strong>25%</strong> through more targeted outreach.</li></ul><p>I am currently seeking a remote Data Analyst role where I can apply my skills in data storytelling and statistical analysis to solve challenging business problems. Feel free to connect or reach out to me at [<a href="mailto:your.email@email.com">your.email@email.com</a>].&quot;</p><p>This example is scannable, packed with keywords, and demonstrates tangible business impact. It gives recruiters everything they need to move you to the &quot;yes&quot; pile.</p><h2>Turn Your Experience Section into a Story of Impact</h2><p>After your headline, the Experience section is where recruiters spend the most time. Your headline gets them to click, but your experience convinces them to stay.</p><p>Many data professionals treat this section like a copy and paste of their job description. That’s a mistake. To stand out, you need to stop listing tasks and start showcasing your quantifiable impact.</p><p>Instead of saying you “analyzed data,” you must show what happened because you analyzed it. This is your chance to connect your skills in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">SQL</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, or <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power BI</a> to real business outcomes. You are telling a story, one bullet point at a time.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/694b779551ffe459351b0150_how-to-optimize-linkedin-profile-etl-optimization.jpeg" alt="LinkedIn experience card showing 30% ETL speed increase with bar chart, code icon, and interface." loading="lazy" /></p><p>This visual is the perfect model. It is not just a task. It is a specific, measurable achievement that immediately communicates value. That is the goal for every bullet point.</p><h3>From Passive Duties to Active Achievements</h3><p>The secret to a powerful experience section is simple: frame everything in terms of results. Hiring managers do not just look for someone who knows their way around <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>. They want the person who used Tableau to build dashboards that led to a <strong>10% increase</strong> in operational efficiency.</p><p>A good model for this is the <strong>STAR method</strong> (Situation, Task, Action, Result). For each bullet point, you briefly set the stage, describe your action, and most importantly, quantify the outcome.</p><p>Think back on your past roles. Did you automate a report? How much time did that save the team each week? Did you build a predictive model? How accurate was it, and what key decision did it drive? These are the details that get you noticed.</p><h3>Crafting Impactful Bullet Points</h3><p>Let’s get practical. Here is how you can transform generic duties into powerful, results driven achievements.</p><p><strong>Before:</strong></p><ul><li>Wrote Python scripts for data cleaning.</li><li>Built dashboards in Power BI.</li><li>Managed the company&#39;s SQL database.</li></ul><p>These are okay, but they do not tell a recruiter about the value you created. They just list tasks.</p><p><strong>After:</strong></p><ul><li>Developed Python scripts using Pandas to automate data cleaning, reducing data prep time by <strong>30%</strong> for the analytics team.</li><li>Designed and deployed interactive Power BI dashboards to track key sales metrics, giving leadership real time insights that contributed to <strong>15% YoY</strong> revenue growth.</li><li>Optimized SQL database queries and implemented new indexing strategies, which improved report generation speed by <strong>40%</strong> across the organization.</li></ul><p>The difference is clear. Each &quot;After&quot; example links a technical skill directly to a measurable business outcome. It uses strong action verbs and includes numbers that hiring managers can see.</p><blockquote><p>Your goal for each bullet point is to answer the question, &quot;So what?&quot; A recruiter should read it and immediately understand the value you delivered in that role. No guesswork required.</p></blockquote><h3>Show, Don’t Just Tell, with Media</h3><p>This is one of the most underused features on LinkedIn. For data professionals, it is a goldmine. You can add rich media like links, documents, and presentations to each experience entry. It is tangible proof of your skills.</p><p>Here is an example of how you can feature media to showcase your work and initiatives.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/694b779551ffe459351b0150_how-to-optimize-linkedin-profile-etl-optimization.jpeg" alt="LinkedIn experience card showing 30% ETL speed increase with bar chart, code icon, and interface." loading="lazy" /></p><p>Adding visuals makes your profile more engaging and credible. This is your chance to visually back up the claims you make in your bullet points.</p><ul><li><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> Do not just say you can code. Link directly to a project that showcases your clean code, analytical process, or a machine learning model.</li><li><strong>Public Tableau Dashboard:</strong> Have a great visualization? Add a link to your Tableau Public profile or a specific dashboard you built. Let them see your work.</li><li><strong>Blog Post or Article:</strong> If you have written about a data project or a new technique, feature it. This highlights your expertise and your communication skills.</li></ul><p>Adding media turns your experience section from a static resume into a dynamic portfolio. It is one of the most effective ways to stand out and proves you take pride in your work.</p><h2>Use Strategic Skills to Dominate Recruiter Searches</h2><p>The Skills section on your LinkedIn profile is SEO fuel. It is not just a list. It is a direct signal to the LinkedIn algorithm, telling it what you are good at. When recruiters hunt for candidates, they use specific skill filters. If the right skills are not on your profile, you are invisible.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/694b779551ffe459351b0153_how-to-optimize-linkedin-profile-skills-search.jpeg" alt="A recruiter search interface displaying various skills for a Data Analyst, including SQL, Python, AWS, and Tableau." loading="lazy" /></p><p>This is one of the most direct ways to influence how often you appear in relevant searches. It is a simple lever with a powerful impact.</p><h3>Choosing the Right 50 Skills</h3><p>LinkedIn gives you <strong>50 slots</strong> for skills, and you should use every single one. This is not the time for modesty. Your goal is to build a complete map of your entire technical and professional toolkit.</p><p>Recruiters are focused on finding specific qualifications. Adding precise, relevant skills helps you align your profile with the exact way hiring managers think and operate.</p><p>Start by listing every tool, technique, and programming language you have used. Then, get strategic. Pull up job descriptions for the remote data roles you want. Look for the skills that appear repeatedly. Those are your keywords. Make sure they are on your profile.</p><h3>Curated Skills for Data Professionals</h3><p>To get you started, here are some of the most in demand skills for data roles. Use these as a foundation, but customize the list to reflect your own experience. For a deeper dive, check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/top-10-in-demand-skills-for-remote-work-in-2025">top 10 in demand skills for remote work</a>.</p><p><strong>For Data Analysts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Core Technical:</strong> SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), R, Microsoft Excel</li><li><strong>BI &amp; Visualization:</strong> Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Qlik</li><li><strong>Databases:</strong> PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Google BigQuery</li><li><strong>Concepts:</strong> A/B Testing, Data Modeling, Statistical Analysis, ETL</li></ul><p><strong>For Data Scientists:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Programming &amp; ML:</strong> Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), R</li><li><strong>Big Data Tech:</strong> Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka</li><li><strong>Cloud Platforms:</strong> AWS (S3, Redshift, SageMaker), Azure, GCP</li><li><strong>Concepts:</strong> Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning</li></ul><blockquote><p>Your skills list should be a direct reflection of the jobs you are targeting. If a job requires Power BI and you have it listed, your chances of showing up in that recruiter’s search increase significantly.</p></blockquote><h3>Pin Your Top Skills and Seek Endorsements</h3><p>Once your list is solid, LinkedIn lets you &quot;pin&quot; your top three skills. These are displayed most prominently to anyone visiting your profile, so choose them wisely. Pick the three that are most critical for your target roles. For a Data Analyst, this might be <strong>SQL, Python, and Tableau</strong>.</p><p>Pinning your skills makes an immediate, powerful impression. It tells recruiters at a glance what your core competencies are, reinforcing the story from your headline and summary.</p><p>Finally, endorsements add a layer of social proof. While they do not carry the same weight as a recommendation, they help validate your expertise. When a connection endorses you for a skill, it signals to the algorithm and to people that your claims are legitimate.</p><p>Do not be shy about asking colleagues to endorse your key skills, and return the favor. A well endorsed skills section builds credibility and helps you stand out in a crowded field.</p><h2>Advanced LinkedIn Strategies for Data Professionals</h2><p>Ready to move beyond the basics? Once your profile is solid, it is time to dig into some of LinkedIn’s more powerful features. This is how you shift your profile from a passive resume into an active showcase of your expertise. For data professionals, this is what separates you from being just another applicant with SQL skills to being a genuine thought leader.</p><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXZG8M21FXA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div></div><p>Taking these extra steps makes a huge difference in how recruiters see you. It positions you as an engaged, proactive expert in the data and analytics world.</p><h3>Activate Creator Mode to Showcase Your Expertise</h3><p>Think of Creator Mode as a switch that turns your static profile page into a dynamic content hub. It shifts the focus from your connections to the original content you produce. It puts your posts, articles, and newsletters front and center.</p><p>For a data analyst, this is an incredible opportunity.</p><p>Instead of just listing &quot;Data Visualization&quot; as a skill, you can publish a post with a screenshot of a <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> dashboard you built. Explain the insights it uncovered. You are not just telling them you have the skill, you are showing them.</p><p>Creator Mode also changes the main call to action on your profile from &quot;Connect&quot; to &quot;Follow,&quot; which helps you build a broader audience. You start building a personal brand and establishing yourself as a voice in the data community. It’s a clear signal to recruiters that you actively contribute to your field.</p><h3>Post Content That Proves Your Skills</h3><p>With Creator Mode on, your content strategy becomes your secret weapon. The feature&#39;s real power comes alive when you start sharing valuable insights. According to LinkedIn, over <strong>11 million users</strong> have activated Creator Mode to amplify their professional reach.</p><p>Do not forget visuals. Pairing your posts with relevant images can double your engagement. Research shows that articles formatted as &quot;how to&quot; guides or lists perform well. This format is perfect for breaking down a technical concept or walking through a project. You can find more stats on LinkedIn content strategy from <a href="https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/linkedin-statistics">The Social Shepherd</a>.</p><p>Here are a few content ideas for data professionals:</p><ul><li><strong>Project Walkthroughs:</strong> Write a short post detailing a recent project. Explain the problem, the tools you used (like <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> or <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power BI</a>), and the quantifiable results you delivered.</li><li><strong>Technical Tips:</strong> Share a clever SQL query trick or a tip for optimizing a dashboard. This proves you have practical, hands on knowledge.</li><li><strong>Industry Commentary:</strong> Offer your take on a new data trend or a recently published industry report. This shows you’re an informed professional.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Posting consistently, even just once a week, keeps you on recruiters&#39; radar. It shows you are passionate and engaged with your work beyond your daily responsibilities.</p></blockquote><p>This consistent activity feeds the LinkedIn algorithm, boosting your visibility and making it more likely your profile will appear in recruiter searches.</p><h3>Signal Your Intent with Open to Work</h3><p>The &quot;Open to Work&quot; feature is your direct line to recruiters. You have to use it correctly to protect your privacy and attract the right opportunities. The tool lets you privately signal to recruiters that you are looking for a new role without alerting your entire network or your current boss.</p><p>When you turn it on, you can get specific about your job search, which is critical for data professionals hunting for remote work.</p><p>You can set these key preferences:</p><ul><li><strong>Job Titles:</strong> List the specific roles you are targeting, like &quot;Data Analyst&quot; or &quot;BI Developer.&quot;</li><li><strong>Workplace Type:</strong> Select <strong>&quot;Remote&quot;</strong> here to make sure you show up in searches for remote only positions.</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> If you are open to hybrid roles, you can specify your preferred cities.</li><li><strong>Start Date and Job Type:</strong> Let them know your availability and whether you are looking for full time, contract, or part time work.</li></ul><p>By setting these preferences, you filter out the noise and ensure only recruiters with matching opportunities see your signal. It is a targeted approach that saves you time and connects you with the right hiring managers.</p><h2>Your Top LinkedIn Questions, Answered</h2><p>Optimizing your LinkedIn profile always brings up questions. As a data professional, you want every move to be strategic. Let&#39;s clear up some of the most common questions so you can fine tune your profile with confidence.</p><h3>How Many LinkedIn Connections Do I Really Need?</h3><p>While quality beats quantity, hitting the <strong>“500+” connections milestone</strong> is a smart strategic move. When you cross that threshold, LinkedIn stops showing the exact number. It is a subtle but powerful signal to recruiters that you have an established professional network.</p><p>Focus on building a relevant network. Connect with current and former colleagues, peers in the data community, and recruiters who specialize in remote tech roles. A larger, relevant network boosts your visibility in search results, making it easier for hiring managers to find you.</p><h3>Are LinkedIn Recommendations Still Important?</h3><p>Yes, they are. Think of recommendations as public testimonials that prove you can do what your profile claims. They add a layer of credibility that a simple skill endorsement cannot touch. Your goal should be to get <strong>two to three high quality recommendations</strong> from people who have directly managed you or worked with you on a project.</p><p>When you ask for one, make it easy for the other person. Do not just send the generic request. Gently guide them. For instance, you could say, &quot;Would you be willing to write a quick recommendation about the work we did on the Q3 sales forecasting model?&quot; A specific, glowing review of your Python skills or your talent for building insightful <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> dashboards can convince a recruiter to reach out.</p><blockquote><p>A recommendation is social proof. It is a former manager or senior colleague publicly vouching for your expertise and work ethic, which is invaluable to a hiring manager.</p></blockquote><p>This kind of third party validation carries serious weight.</p><h3>How Often Should I Post to Stay on a Recruiter’s Radar?</h3><p>Consistency is more important than frequency. You do not need to post every day to stay visible. A great rhythm to aim for is engaging with the platform <strong>two to three times per week</strong>. That is enough to keep your profile active in the algorithm.</p><p>&quot;Engagement&quot; does not always mean writing a long post. Your activity can be varied and strategic:</p><ul><li>Share an insightful industry report with a sentence or two of your own take.</li><li>Leave a thoughtful comment on a post from a thought leader or a target company.</li><li>Congratulate a connection on a new job or work anniversary.</li></ul><p>These simple actions signal that you are an active, engaged professional invested in the data and analytics field.</p><h3>What Is the Best Way to Find Keywords for My Profile?</h3><p>The job market is your best keyword research tool. Find <strong>5 to 10 job descriptions</strong> for the remote data analyst or data scientist roles you are targeting. As you read them, pull out the recurring skills, tools, and concepts.</p><p>You will quickly build a list of common terms. Technical skills like &quot;SQL,&quot; &quot;Python,&quot; &quot;<a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power BI</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>&quot; will likely appear, along with concepts like &quot;data modeling,&quot; &quot;ETL processes,&quot; and &quot;A/B testing.&quot; These are the exact terms recruiters use in their searches.</p><p>Once you have your list, weave these keywords throughout your entire profile. Use them in your headline, &quot;About&quot; section, experience bullets, and the Skills section. This alignment dramatically increases your chances of getting discovered.</p><hr><p>Ready to stop manually tailoring your resume for every application? <strong>Jobsolv</strong>’s free ATS approved resume builder helps you instantly create optimized resumes that match the keywords in any job description. <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com">Get started and land more interviews</a>.</p>
