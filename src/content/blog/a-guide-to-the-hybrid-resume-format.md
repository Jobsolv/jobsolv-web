<p>A <strong>hybrid resume format</strong> combines the best features of a traditional reverse chronological resume and a skills focused functional one. For data and analytics professionals seeking remote jobs, this format is the best way to showcase your value. It lets you lead with your most valuable skills—like SQL, Python, or Tableau—at the top, ensuring a hiring manager sees your technical abilities first.</p><p>This structure allows you to control your career story from the very first line, which is critical for getting past the initial six second review.</p><h2>Why The Hybrid Resume Format Wins for Data Roles</h2><p>In data analytics, your resume has about six seconds to make an impression. The hybrid format is designed for that reality. It places your most important technical skills and qualifications front and center, immediately answering the recruiter’s main question: “Does this person have the technical skills to do the job?”</p><p>Instead of making a hiring manager search through job descriptions to find mentions of <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power BI</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, you present them in a dedicated skills summary. This approach is powerful because it aligns with how both modern recruiters and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan for critical keywords.</p><p>For any data professional, the advantages are clear:</p><ul><li><strong>It Highlights Your Technical Skills:</strong> Your proficiency with in demand tools, from specific machine learning libraries to data visualization software, is the first thing a recruiter sees.</li><li><strong>It Frames Your Career Story:</strong> You control the narrative. This is ideal if you have a non linear career path, a series of freelance projects, or are pivoting into data science from another field.</li><li><strong>It Balances Skills and Experience:</strong> You prove you have the necessary skills <em>and</em> show a clear, logical career progression.</li></ul><h3>Choosing The Right Resume Format for Data Analytics</h3><p>To understand why the hybrid format is superior for data and analytics roles, let&#39;s compare it to the other two main types. Each has its use, but for a field where technical skills are the priority, the choice is clear.</p><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 20px;"><thead><tr><th align="left">Format</th><th align="left">Best For</th><th align="left">Key Weakness</th><th align="left">ATS Friendliness</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><strong>Chronological</strong></td><td align="left">Professionals with a long, linear career path in one industry.</td><td align="left">Buries skills deep within job descriptions; weak for career changers.</td><td align="left">High</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>Functional</strong></td><td align="left">Freelancers, career changers, or those with significant employment gaps.</td><td align="left">Often distrusted by recruiters who want to see a clear work history.</td><td align="left">Low to Medium</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>Hybrid</strong></td><td align="left"><strong>Most data professionals</strong>, career changers, and technical specialists.</td><td align="left">Can be slightly longer if not edited carefully.</td><td align="left"><strong>Very High</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>While a chronological resume is ATS friendly, it fails to showcase skills effectively. The functional resume highlights skills but often raises red flags for recruiters. The hybrid model provides the keyword optimization of the chronological format with the skill forward approach of the functional one, making it the clear winner for data professionals.</p><h3>The Modern Choice for Data Careers</h3><p>The rise of the hybrid resume is a direct response to how modern careers work, with more project based work, frequent job changes, and increased specialization.</p><p>For data roles, you must show you understand the job’s day to day requirements. A great way to check your resume&#39;s skills section is to review <a href="https://querio.ai/articles/what-does-a-data-analyst-do">the core responsibilities of a Data Analyst</a> and ensure you are hitting all the key points employers look for.</p><blockquote><p>The hybrid resume format has gained significant momentum and preference among job seekers and recruiters globally starting around the early 2020s. This format blends the chronological resume&#39;s emphasis on work history with the functional resume&#39;s focus on skills, creating a versatile presentation that suits diverse career trajectories.</p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, choosing a hybrid resume is a strategic decision. You are building a document that works for the ATS <em>and</em> grabs the attention of a human reader, giving you a serious advantage in your job search.</p><h2>How to Structure Your Hybrid Resume</h2><p>Think of building a hybrid resume like designing a high impact dashboard. You need the most critical information—your core skills and biggest wins—front and center, easy to see at a glance.</p><p>Let’s walk through how to build each section to capture attention, satisfy the ATS, and make a compelling case for you.</p><p>This diagram breaks down how the hybrid format blends the best of both worlds: the skills first approach of a functional resume and the familiar career story of a chronological one.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/691b801b3bb7723fe559cd84_154791ff-cdea-4cfc-a745-07115633798e.jpeg" alt="Infographic about hybrid resume format" loading="lazy" /></p><p>As you can see, it strikes the perfect balance. You showcase your abilities right away without losing the clear career narrative that recruiters expect.</p><h3>The Essential Sections of a Hybrid Resume</h3><p>Your hybrid resume should follow a specific flow designed to guide a recruiter’s eyes from your most impressive qualifications down to the experience that proves them. While the content will change for each job, the structure remains consistent.</p><p>Here’s the standard layout that works every time:</p><ol><li><strong>Contact Information</strong> (Name, Location, Email, LinkedIn, Portfolio Link)</li><li><strong>Professional Summary</strong> (A 2 to 4 sentence snapshot of your career)</li><li><strong>Skills Summary</strong> (A categorized list of your technical and soft skills)</li><li><strong>Professional Experience</strong> (Your work history, laid out in reverse chronological order)</li><li><strong>Education &amp; Certifications</strong> (Degrees, bootcamps, and key credentials)</li></ol><p>This order is deliberate. It ensures a hiring manager sees your name, elevator pitch, and hard skills within seconds. That’s what it takes to pass the initial six second scan and convince them to keep reading.</p><h3>Crafting Your Skills Summary</h3><p>This section is the core of your hybrid resume. This is where you prove you have the technical skills for the job before the recruiter even looks at your work history.</p><p>Do not just list random skills. Group them into logical categories to make your expertise easier to understand.</p><p>For a data professional, your categories might look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Programming &amp; Databases:</strong> SQL (PostgreSQL, T-SQL), Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R</li><li><strong>BI &amp; Visualization Tools:</strong> Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Excel (Advanced)</li><li><strong>Cloud &amp; Big Data:</strong> AWS (S3, Redshift), Azure, Databricks, ETL Pipelines</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> A/B Testing, Regression Analysis, Predictive Modeling</li></ul><p>By organizing your skills this way, you make it simple for both the ATS and a human screener to confirm you meet the role’s technical requirements.</p><blockquote><p>Your skills section should be a direct mirror of the job description. If a role requires Power BI and SQL, those two skills should be featured prominently. This is how you get past automated filters and into a real person&#39;s hands.</p></blockquote><p>Using an ATS approved resume builder like Jobsolv’s can help you quickly align your skills with each job you apply for, saving you from constant manual rewrites.</p><h3>Detailing Your Professional Experience</h3><p>While skills get top billing, your work history provides the proof. This section should always be in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent role.</p><p>The key difference is that every bullet point on a hybrid resume must demonstrate impact. The best way to do that is with the <strong>CAR method (Challenge-Action-Result)</strong>.</p><p>For each bullet point, frame your accomplishment by considering:</p><ul><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> What was the business problem or goal?</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> What specific data skills or tools did you use to address it?</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> What was the measurable, quantifiable outcome of your work?</li></ul><p>This method turns a passive duty into a powerful story of your achievements. To explore other resume structures, our guide on <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/is-reverse-chronological-order-the-best-resume-format"><strong>whether reverse-chronological order is the best resume format</strong></a> offers a deeper comparison.</p><h3>Real-World Examples Using the CAR Method</h3><p>Let’s put the CAR method into practice. Here are a couple of examples for data analytics roles that show how powerful this framing can be.</p><p><strong>Generic Bullet Point:</strong></p><ul><li>Responsible for creating reports for the marketing team.</li></ul><p><strong>CAR Method Bullet Point:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Automated</strong> weekly marketing campaign performance reports using <strong>Python and Tableau</strong>, which <strong>reduced manual reporting time by 15 hours per week</strong> and gave stakeholders real time dashboard access.</li></ul><p><strong>Generic Bullet Point:</strong></p><ul><li>Analyzed customer data to find trends.</li></ul><p><strong>CAR Method Bullet Point:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Developed</strong> a customer segmentation model with <strong>SQL and Scikit-learn</strong> that identified three high value customer segments, directly informing a targeted marketing strategy that <strong>lifted customer retention by 12%</strong> in six months.</li></ul><p>The improved versions use strong action verbs, name the specific tools you used (Python, Tableau, SQL), and provide a clear, number driven result. That is the level of detail that separates your resume from the rest.</p><h2>Crafting a Skills Section That Gets Noticed</h2><p>For any data professional, the skills section is the most valuable real estate on your resume. It&#39;s often the first place a recruiter or hiring manager looks to confirm you have the technical skills for the job. In a hybrid resume, this section sits right under your professional summary, giving you an immediate opportunity to grab their attention.</p><p>A well organized skills section lets a reviewer quickly confirm you meet the core requirements. This encourages them to read the rest of your resume with interest. It&#39;s your chance to show off your entire technical toolkit in one clean, scannable snapshot.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/691b801b3bb7723fe559cd81_eceb2809-e090-4cfe-883b-5011ef294364.jpeg" alt="Data analyst looking at a computer screen with code and charts" loading="lazy" /></p><h3>How to Group Your Technical Skills for Maximum Impact</h3><p>Avoid the common mistake of listing every technology you have ever used in one long list. Instead, group your skills into logical categories. This strategy makes your expertise much easier to understand and proves you know how these tools fit together in a real world data environment.</p><p>Your goal is to mirror the language and structure of the job description you are targeting.</p><p>Here are a few common categories that work well for data professionals:</p><ul><li><strong>Programming &amp; Databases:</strong> SQL (T-SQL, PostgreSQL), Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R</li><li><strong>BI &amp; Visualization Tools:</strong> Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Qlik, Advanced Excel</li><li><strong>Cloud Platforms &amp; Big Data:</strong> AWS (S3, Redshift), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Databricks</li><li><strong>Data Modeling &amp; Warehousing:</strong> ETL/ELT Pipelines, Star Schema, Snowflake, BigQuery</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis &amp; Machine Learning:</strong> A/B Testing, Regression Analysis, Predictive Modeling, TensorFlow</li></ul><p>By organizing your skills this way, you make it easy for both Applicant Tracking Systems and human screeners to see you are a strong technical fit.</p><h3>Add Context to Prove Proficiency</h3><p>Just listing &quot;SQL&quot; is not enough. You must provide context that demonstrates your level of expertise. Adding specifics shows you have a deeper understanding of the tool and how it is applied to solve business problems.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Instead of just listing the skill, add a short parenthetical note to describe your specific capabilities. This simple trick turns a generic skill into a compelling statement of your proficiency.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Check out these examples:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Weak:</strong> SQL</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong:</strong> Advanced SQL (window functions, CTEs, complex joins, stored procedures)</p></li><li><p><strong>Weak:</strong> Python</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong:</strong> Python (Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, Scikit-learn for modeling)</p></li><li><p><strong>Weak:</strong> Tableau</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong:</strong> Tableau (interactive dashboard development, LOD expressions, data storytelling)</p></li></ul><p>This extra detail proves you are not just familiar with the terms but have hands on experience using these tools for complex data work. For more ideas, take a look at our guide on <a href="https://www.jobsolv.com/blog/what-skills-should-i-put-on-my-resume-this-ai-tool-can-help">what skills you should put on your resume</a> for data focused roles.</p><h3>Do Not Forget Essential Soft Skills</h3><p>While technical abilities are critical, remote and hybrid roles demand strong soft skills. Employers need to know you can work effectively without direct supervision. Including these skills shows you understand the unique demands of a distributed team.</p><p>Recent data from <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/resume-formats">resume formatting trends on Jobscan</a> shows that candidates using hybrid resumes tend to list a broader range of skills, with the average now at about 11. Since 2020, there has been a significant increase in job seekers citing skills valuable for remote work.</p><p>Include a small, dedicated section for these crucial abilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Stakeholder Communication:</strong> Clearly explaining technical findings to non technical audiences.</li><li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Using tools like Jira or Asana to manage timelines and deliverables.</li><li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Demonstrating your ability to think critically and resolve complex issues.</li><li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Proving you can prioritize tasks and meet deadlines independently.</li></ul><p>By creating a skills section that is organized, detailed, and balanced, you build a powerful snapshot of your capabilities that will get you noticed for all the right reasons.</p><h2>Tailoring Your Resume for ATS and Recruiters</h2><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0jQwXfsOds4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div></div><p>Having a perfectly structured hybrid resume is a great start, but you must tailor your resume for every single job you apply for. This is the single most effective action you can take to land more interviews for remote data jobs.</p><p>Why? Because many companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to screen candidates. These systems are not looking for the &quot;best&quot; candidate; they are programmed to find the <em>most relevant</em> one by scanning for keywords from the job description.</p><p>Your mission is to make your resume a mirror of the role’s requirements. When you do that, the ATS will give you a high match score, pushing your application to the top of the recruiter&#39;s list.</p><h3>How ATS Software Screens Your Resume</h3><p>Think of an ATS as a data filtering tool, not an intelligent reader. It scans your resume for keywords that match the employer&#39;s needs.</p><p>These keywords are often hard skills like “ETL pipelines,” “A/B testing,” or “machine learning models.” They also include specific tools like “Tableau” or “Power BI” and soft skills like “stakeholder management.”</p><p>The system then scores your resume based on how many of these keywords it finds. A resume with the right terms gets a high rank and is flagged for human review. A generic resume, no matter how impressive your background, will likely be filtered out. To get this right, it helps to understand <a href="https://profilespider.com/blog/ai-in-recruiting-what-it-can-and-cant-do-right-now">the capabilities of AI in recruiting</a>, since these technologies drive the screening process.</p><h3>A Step-by-Step Guide to Resume Tailoring</h3><p>Customizing your resume does not mean rewriting it from scratch every time. It is a strategic editing process where you identify and integrate the most important keywords from the job description.</p><p>Follow these steps for every application:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Analyze the Job Description:</strong> Copy the entire job description into a text document. Identify the technical skills, tools, and qualifications that appear most often. These are your target keywords.</p></li><li><p><strong>Map Keywords to Your Resume:</strong> Create a simple two column list. On one side, list the target keywords. On the other, note where you have used that skill or tool in your career. This map will guide your edits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrate Keywords Naturally:</strong> Add your target keywords throughout your resume. The highest impact spots are your Professional Summary, Skills section, and the bullet points under your Professional Experience.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><strong>Crucial Tip:</strong> Do not just stuff keywords in. The language must sound natural and make sense in context. Instead of just listing &quot;SQL,&quot; write something like, &quot;Developed complex SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from disparate sources, improving report accuracy.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This process ensures your resume speaks the exact language the ATS and recruiter are looking for.

Imagine you are applying for a Data Analyst role where the job description repeatedly mentions &quot;Power BI,&quot; &quot;KPI dashboards,&quot; and &quot;stakeholder reporting.&quot;</p><p>See how a generic bullet point is transformed into an ATS optimized statement by incorporating keywords.</p><h3>Before and After Resume Tailoring for a Data Role</h3><div class="w-richtext"><div class="w-embed"><table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 20px;"><thead><tr><th align="left">Original Bullet Point</th><th align="left">Target Job Keywords</th><th align="left">Optimized Bullet Point</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">&quot;Created weekly reports for the sales team using company software.&quot;</td><td align="left">Power BI, KPI dashboards, stakeholder reporting</td><td align="left">&quot;Designed and implemented interactive <strong>Power BI</strong> <strong>KPI dashboards</strong> to track sales performance, providing real time insights for <strong>stakeholder reporting</strong> and strategic decisions.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The optimized version is more powerful because it directly hits the keywords the ATS is looking for while painting a clearer picture of your accomplishments. This is the level of detail that gets you interviews. Jobsolv&#39;s free resume builder automates this process, letting you generate an optimized resume for any data role in one click.</p><h3>Addressing Gaps and Career Changes</h3><p>Career paths in data analytics are rarely a straight line. You might have taken time off, pursued freelance work, or are pivoting from a different industry. A hybrid resume is the best tool for turning these detours into a narrative of strength.</p><p>This format lets you control the conversation. By leading with a strong skills summary, you immediately show a recruiter what you can <em>do</em>. Any employment gaps or varied history gets pushed to the background.</p><h4>Turning Gaps into Strengths</h4><p>The key to handling a career gap is not to hide it but to show you were still moving forward. Your hybrid resume’s skills section is the perfect place for this. You can spotlight new skills you acquired or projects you completed outside of a traditional job.</p><p>Here’s how to frame it:</p><ul><li><strong>Spotlight New Credentials:</strong> Did you earn a <a href="https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/">Google Data Analytics Certificate</a> or an AWS certification? Feature it in a dedicated &quot;Certifications&quot; section or your summary.</li><li><strong>Show Off Your Projects:</strong> If you built a dashboard on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/discover">Tableau Public</a> or analyzed a public dataset with Python, create a &quot;Projects&quot; section to detail your work. This provides hard proof that your skills are current.</li><li><strong>Emphasize Your Drive:</strong> Use proactive language like, &quot;Completed <strong>50+</strong> hours of advanced SQL training&quot; or &quot;Developed a personal project analyzing market trends.&quot; Show them you never stopped learning.</li></ul><h4>Making a Successful Career Transition</h4><p>If you&#39;re breaking into data analytics from another field, the hybrid resume is essential. It lets you lead with your most relevant, transferable skills, making a powerful case for your potential before a hiring manager even sees your old job titles.</p><p>Instead of starting with your past experience in marketing or finance, lead with your proven ability in:</p><ul><li><strong>Critical Thinking &amp; Problem-Solving:</strong> Frame past jobs in terms of how you analyzed problems and developed logical solutions.</li><li><strong>Quantitative Analysis:</strong> Highlight any experience with numbers, like budgets, performance metrics, or sales figures.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder Communication:</strong> Showcase your ability to explain complex topics to non technical people. This is a highly in demand skill for any data professional.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The hybrid resume hits the sweet spot between a detailed work history and a powerful skills first pitch. It’s perfect for tackling the non linear career paths that are becoming more common. You can get more insights on <a href="https://www.resumly.ai/blog/the-best-resume-format-in-2025">resume format strategies on Resumly.ai</a>.</p></blockquote><p>By putting your skills first, you build a bridge from your past experience to your future in data. You become a skilled professional with a unique background, ready to bring a fresh analytical perspective.</p><h2>Data Analyst Hybrid Resume Example and Template</h2><p>Theory is good, but let&#39;s see what this looks like in practice. Here is a complete hybrid resume example for a data analyst. Use it as a blueprint to build your own career story.</p><p>Pay attention to how each section is designed. This template shows you how to organize skills for a quick scan and frame your experience with quantified results.</p><p><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/691b801b3bb7723fe559cd92_c092bea2-c53e-4c60-a00c-f7f1bf74c1b1.jpeg" alt="Data Analyst Hybrid Resume Template" loading="lazy" /></p><h3>Why This Template Works</h3><p>This example follows the core principles of an effective hybrid resume. It places the skills summary front and center, immediately showcasing the candidate&#39;s fluency in SQL, Python, and Tableau.</p><p>This strategic placement ensures both an ATS and a human recruiter can instantly confirm the applicant has the right hard skills. The professional experience section then backs it all up with strong, action oriented bullet points. Each one includes metrics and specific outcomes, like &quot;increased user engagement by <strong>18%</strong>&quot; or &quot;reduced data processing time by <strong>25%</strong>.&quot; This is providing proof, not just listing duties.</p><h3>Key Takeaways from the Example</h3><p>As you adapt this template, focus on these critical elements. They are what make the hybrid format so powerful for data professionals.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Categorized Skills:</strong> Notice how skills are grouped into logical buckets like &quot;Programming &amp; Databases&quot; and &quot;BI &amp; Visualization Tools.&quot; This organization makes your technical skills easy to understand at a glance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantified Achievements:</strong> Every bullet point under your experience should answer the question, &quot;So what?&quot; Always include numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts to show your real world impact.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keyword Alignment:</strong> This template is built for customization. Before sending your application, pull the top keywords from the job description and weave them naturally into your summary, skills list, and work history.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>A great resume is a living document. Tools like Jobsolv’s free resume builder can automate this process, creating an ATS optimized version tailored to any job in seconds.</p></blockquote><p>By using this structure, you create a powerful narrative that leads with your strengths and backs them up with solid evidence. This is the framework that will get you interviews for the remote and hybrid data roles you are targeting.</p><h2>Common Questions About the Hybrid Resume</h2><p>Let&#39;s tackle the most common questions from data professionals so you can use the hybrid format with confidence.</p><h3>Is the Hybrid Format Good for Entry Level Roles?</h3><p>Absolutely. In fact, it&#39;s often the <em>best</em> choice for someone just breaking into a data role. The hybrid format’s strength is that it leads with your skills summary, letting you show off what you can do right away.</p><p>A traditional chronological resume might highlight an unrelated part time job. A hybrid resume immediately puts your most valuable assets front and center.</p><p>For example, you can showcase:</p><ul><li><strong>SQL and Python</strong> mastery you gained from a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics">Google Data Analytics Certificate</a>.</li><li>Your skill in <strong>Tableau or Power BI</strong>, proven by a personal dashboarding project.</li><li>Knowledge of <strong>A/B testing</strong> from a core statistics course.</li></ul><p>This approach helps bypass the &quot;no experience&quot; roadblock. It frames you as a capable analyst with the technical skills to contribute from day one.</p><h3>How Long Should a Hybrid Resume Be?</h3><p>The golden rule for anyone with less than 10 years of experience is a <strong>one page resume</strong>. This forces you to focus on what is truly important.</p><p>The hybrid format makes this easier by focusing on your most relevant skills and impactful results, which helps cut out filler content.</p><p>If you are a senior professional with over a decade of directly relevant experience, a two page resume is acceptable. However, that first page must act as a highlight reel, grabbing the recruiter&#39;s attention immediately with your most critical skills and biggest wins.</p><h3>How Do I Adapt This for a Senior or Leadership Role?</h3><p>The hybrid format scales well for senior and leadership positions, but the focus must shift. Your skills summary should become a blend of high level technical knowledge and proven leadership qualities.</p><p>Instead of just listing tools, you should highlight things like:</p><ul><li>Data Strategy &amp; Governance</li><li>Team Leadership &amp; Mentoring (e.g., “Grew and managed a team of <strong>5</strong> analysts”)</li><li>Budget Management &amp; Stakeholder Communication</li></ul><p>Your experience section needs to reflect this shift as well. Bullet points should demonstrate leadership impact, such as times you drove departmental projects, influenced business strategy with data, or secured buy in from executives. It is less about the code you wrote and more about the change you created.</p><hr><p>Ready to build a resume that actually gets you noticed?
