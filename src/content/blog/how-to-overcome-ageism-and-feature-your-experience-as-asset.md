<p id="">Navigating the job market can be tough, especially when you're facing ageism. With nearly 3.8 million older workers in the US losing jobs during the pandemic, it's more crucial than ever to understand how to overcome ageism in the workplace.</p><p id="">This guide equips you with practical tips on combating age discrimination and positioning your years of experience as a compelling asset to prospective employers.</p><p id="">Ready for your career boost? Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="">Understanding Ageism</h2><p id=""><a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/discrimination/agedisc" target="_blank" id="">Age discrimination</a> is the unfair treatment of individuals based on their age, which can manifest in various forms such as limited job opportunities or biased assumptions about capabilities.</p><h3 id="">What is age discrimination?</h3><p id="">Age discrimination, or ageism, happens when people treat others unfairly because of their age. It can occur anywhere but is often seen in work places. Older workers might not get jobs or promotions because bosses think they are too old.</p><p id="">They may lose their jobs only because they are older than other workers. According to a <a href="https://www.aarp.org/pri/topics/work-finances-retirement/employers-workforce/multicultural-work-jobs-study-2023.html" target="_blank" id="">study by AARP</a>, nearly two out of three workers over 45 years old have faced this type of unfair treatment.</p><p id="">Some people were even forced into retirement during the pandemic due to their age! That’s not right and it is also against the law.</p><h3 id="">Common examples of age discrimination</h3><p id="">Age discrimination happens in many ways. Here are a few examples:</p><ol id=""><li id="">Older workers losing their jobs. From March to April 2020, about 3.8 million older workers in the US lost their jobs due to the pandemic.</li><li id="">Being forced into early retirement. Around 400,000 older workers had to retire one year after the job loss.</li><li id="">Being overlooked for new roles or promotions because of age.</li><li id="">Workplace jokes or comments about a person’s age.</li><li id="">Seeing ads for “young and dynamic” teams, suggesting only young people can fill these roles.</li><li id="">Missing out on training and development chances given to younger colleagues.</li><li id="">Ageist remarks made during job interviews.</li><li id="">Getting lesser pay than younger colleagues doing the same work.</li><li id="">Firing or laying off older staff first during company downsize times.</li><li id="">Older workers getting fewer job callbacks from employers after sending out resumes or job applications.</li></ol><blockquote id="">Key takeaway: <em id="">Age discrimination is a real issue in the workplace, impacting everything from job opportunities to training chances. Being judged based on your age and not your skills. From forced retirement to getting passed over for promotions, it can affect older workers in many ways. Knowing this can help you recognize and challenge ageism in the workplace.</em></blockquote><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><imgsrc="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646ea5cf9a947b6271e0c005/66e92bd11f5446ddb5661b53_65f710f850b81b382876294e_2149341139%2520(1).jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="middle age man working in an offfice" width="auto" height="auto" id="" /></div></figure><h2 id="">How to Overcome Ageism</h2><p id=""><a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/combat-ageism-in-a-job-search/" target="_blank" id="">Combat ageism during your job search</a> by debunking ageist myths and boosting your profile to highlight your skills and experience.</p><h2 id="">How to tackle ageist myths</h2><p id="">Tackling ageist myths is key in your job search.
