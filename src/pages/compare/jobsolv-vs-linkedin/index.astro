      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse specialized remote/hybrid job board, get AI-matched jobs, review tailored resume for each position, approve and apply—all in one platform. Focused on application quality.</p>
      <p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Build professional profile, network with connections, browse job listings, apply through external company sites or LinkedIn's application system. Networking-first approach.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically for each job. You review each one (30-60 seconds) before applying. Job matching happens automatically based on your profile.</p>
      <p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Requires manual profile optimization, networking, and job browsing. No automatic resume tailoring. You must customize applications yourself or use the same profile/resume for all.</p>

      <h3>Output Quality</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with ATS optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Uses your profile or uploaded resume for all applications. No per-job customization unless you manually edit. Quality depends on your profile optimization skills.</p>

      <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Simple setup—create profile, upload resume, start browsing. The platform guides you through tailoring and applications.</p>
      <p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Requires learning profile optimization, networking etiquette, and platform features. Steeper learning curve for effective use.</p>

      <h3>Friction Points</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Smaller job pool focused on remote/hybrid roles. No networking features.</p>
      <p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Highly competitive—hundreds of applicants per job. No automatic resume tailoring. Requires networking and profile maintenance. Premium features cost extra.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn uses your profile or a single uploaded resume for all applications. Jobsolv customizes your resume for every job, matching keywords and skills from each job description. This significantly improves ATS pass rates and interview conversion.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Generic applications get lost in LinkedIn's competitive pool → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher interview rates with targeted applications</p>

      <h3>2. Less Competition</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn has millions of active job seekers competing for the same roles. Jobsolv's specialized remote/hybrid focus means less competition per job. You're not competing against the entire LinkedIn user base.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Getting lost among hundreds of applicants → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Better visibility in less crowded marketplace</p>

      <h3>3. Integrated Application Tools</h3>
      <p>Job board, resume builder, tailoring, and tracking in one place. LinkedIn requires you to manage profile, networking, job browsing, and applications separately. Jobsolv streamlines the entire application process.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Managing multiple disconnected tools and processes → <strong>Outcome:</strong> One platform for browsing, tailoring, and applying</p>

      <h3>4. Free Access to Core Features</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn's free tier has limitations, and premium features cost extra. Jobsolv's free tier includes the job board, resume builder, job tracker, and limited resume tailoring. You can start applying immediately without payment.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Premium features required for effective job search → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Start applying with full features at zero cost</p>

      <h3>5. Specialized Remote/Hybrid Focus</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv curates remote and hybrid roles paying $100K+, updated daily. LinkedIn has all job types, requiring extensive filtering. Jobsolv saves time by focusing on roles that match your preferences.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Wasting time filtering through irrelevant jobs → <strong>Outcome:</strong> See only relevant remote/hybrid high-paying roles</p>

      <h2>Where LinkedIn Is Stronger</h2>

      <h3>Professional Networking</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn excels at networking, connecting with recruiters, and building professional relationships. Jobsolv focuses on applications, not networking. If networking is your primary job search strategy, LinkedIn is essential.</p>

      <h3>Company Research and Insights</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn provides comprehensive company pages, employee insights, salary data, and company culture information. Jobsolv offers basic company overviews. For deep company research, LinkedIn is superior.</p>

      <h3>Job Market Size</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn has the largest job marketplace with millions of listings across all industries and locations. Jobsolv focuses on remote/hybrid roles, so the job pool is smaller but more targeted.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Can I use Jobsolv and LinkedIn together?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Many job seekers use LinkedIn for networking and company research, then use Jobsolv for tailored applications to remote/hybrid roles. They complement each other well.</p>

      <h3>Does LinkedIn tailor resumes for each job?</h3>
      <p>No. LinkedIn uses your profile or uploaded resume for all applications. You must manually customize applications. Jobsolv automatically tailors your resume for each job posting.</p>

      <h3>Which platform has more job listings?</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn has the largest job marketplace with millions of listings. Jobsolv focuses on remote/hybrid roles paying $100K+, so the pool is smaller but more targeted and less competitive.</p>

      <h3>Is Jobsolv free like LinkedIn?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Jobsolv offers a forever-free plan with core features. LinkedIn's free tier has limitations, and premium features cost extra. Both have free options, but Jobsolv's free tier includes resume tailoring.</p>

      <h3>Which tool gets more interviews?</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv typically generates higher interview rates per application because each resume is tailored to the specific job. LinkedIn may have more opportunities, but competition is much higher, reducing individual success rates.</p>
