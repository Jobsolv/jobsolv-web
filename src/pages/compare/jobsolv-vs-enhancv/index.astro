      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse integrated job board, get AI-tailored resume for each position, approve and auto-apply. Complete application workflow in one platform.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhancv:</strong> Choose creative template, customize design and content, export resume, apply manually to jobs elsewhere. Resume builder only, no application workflow.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically per job. Auto-apply handles submission for supported roles. You review tailored resumes (30-60 seconds) before applying.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhancv:</strong> Provides creative templates but requires manual customization per job. No automation for tailoring or application submission.</p>

      <h3>Resume Quality and Tailoring</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with keyword optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhancv:</strong> Offers creative, personality-driven designs but requires manual customization per job. No automatic per-job tailoring or keyword optimization.</p>

      <h3>Time to Value</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> See tailored resumes and applications within minutes. Auto-apply accelerates volume for remote roles.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhancv:</strong> Faster initial resume creation with templates. Value in creative design, but manual customization adds time per application.</p>

      <h3>Friction and Limitations</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Less focus on creative design.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhancv:</strong> No auto-apply or job board means manual application process. Resume tailoring requires manual work. Premium needed for full features. Creative designs may not pass all ATS systems.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>

      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Manually customizing resumes takes hours → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Automatic per-job customization in seconds</p>

      <h3>2. Auto-Apply Capability</h3>

      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Applying to many jobs takes hours → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Automated submissions while you focus on interviews</p>

      <h3>3. Integrated Job Board</h3>
      <p>Browse, tailor, and apply all in one platform with curated remote/hybrid roles. Enhancv has no job board; you must find jobs elsewhere.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Switching between job boards and tools → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Complete workflow in one place</p>

      <h3>4. Better ATS Optimization</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv formats resumes specifically for ATS systems per job. Enhancv's creative designs may not pass all ATS filters, especially for technical roles.</p>

      <h3>5. Complete Application Workflow</h3>
