      <h1>Jobsolv vs Huntr: Which Is Better for Job Search Organization?</h1>
      
      <p>You're comparing job search tools. Huntr offers application tracking, pipeline management, and job organization. Jobsolv tailors resumes per job and provides auto-apply with an integrated job board.</p>
      
      <p>This comparison is for job seekers deciding between application tracking (Huntr) and automated application workflow (Jobsolv).</p>

      <div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; margin: 2rem 0;">
        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Jobsolv wins for job seekers who want per-job resume tailoring, auto-apply capabilities, and an integrated remote job board. Huntr is better if you only need application tracking and organization without resume automation.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Job seekers who want automated applications with tailored resumes | <strong>Not ideal for:</strong> Users who only need tracking without full workflow</p>

      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse integrated job board, get AI-tailored resume for each position, approve and auto-apply, track applications. Complete application workflow in one platform.</p>
      <p><strong>Huntr:</strong> Find jobs elsewhere, apply manually, track applications in Huntr with detailed organization. Tracking tool only, no application workflow.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically per job. Auto-apply handles submission for supported roles. You review tailored resumes (30-60 seconds) before applying.</p>
      <p><strong>Huntr:</strong> Provides tracking and organization but requires manual application submission. No automation for resume tailoring or applications.</p>

      <h3>Resume Quality and Tailoring</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with keyword optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>Huntr:</strong> No resume tailoring or optimization. You must create and customize resumes manually elsewhere.</p>

      <h3>Time to Value</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> See tailored resumes and applications within minutes. Auto-apply accelerates volume for remote roles.</p>
      <p><strong>Huntr:</strong> Faster organization and tracking setup. Value in pipeline management, but manual application process adds time per application.</p>

      <h3>Friction and Limitations</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Less focus on detailed pipeline management.</p>
      <p><strong>Huntr:</strong> No auto-apply or job board means manual application process. No resume tailoring or optimization. Premium needed for advanced features.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>Huntr provides tracking but no resume tailoring. Jobsolv automatically tailors your resume for each job, matching keywords and skills from each job description.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Generic resumes get rejected → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher interview rates with targeted applications</p>

      <h3>2. Auto-Apply Capability</h3>

      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Applying to many jobs takes hours → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Automated submissions while you focus on interviews</p>

      <h3>3. Integrated Job Board</h3>
      <p>Browse, tailor, and apply all in one platform with curated remote/hybrid roles. Huntr has no job board; you must find jobs elsewhere.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Switching between job boards and tools → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Complete workflow in one place</p>

      <h3>4. Resume Builder Included</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv includes a free ATS-optimized resume builder. Huntr requires you to create resumes elsewhere and only tracks applications.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Need separate tools for resumes and tracking → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Everything in one platform</p>

      <h3>5. Better Application Quality</h3>
      <p>Per-job tailoring typically generates higher interview rates than generic resumes. Jobsolv ensures each application is optimized for the specific role.</p>
