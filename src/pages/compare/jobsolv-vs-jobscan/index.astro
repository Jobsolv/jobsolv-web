      <h1>Jobsolv vs Jobscan: Which Is Better for ATS-Optimized Resumes?</h1>
      
      <p>You're comparing ATS optimization tools. Jobscan scans your resume against job descriptions and shows keyword matches. Jobsolv tailors resumes per job and provides auto-apply with an integrated job board.</p>
      
      <p>This comparison is for job seekers deciding between resume scanning and matching (Jobscan) and automated application workflow (Jobsolv).</p>

      <div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; margin: 2rem 0;">
        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Jobsolv wins for job seekers who want per-job resume tailoring, auto-apply capabilities, and an integrated remote job board. Jobscan is better if you only need resume scanning and keyword matching without application automation.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Job seekers who want automated applications with tailored resumes | <strong>Not ideal for:</strong> Users who only need resume scanning without full workflow</p>

      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse integrated job board, get AI-tailored resume for each position, approve and auto-apply. Complete application workflow in one platform.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobscan:</strong> Upload resume and job description, get match score and keyword suggestions, manually edit resume, apply elsewhere. Scanning tool only, no application workflow.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically per job. Auto-apply handles submission for supported roles. You review tailored resumes (30-60 seconds) before applying.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobscan:</strong> Provides scanning and suggestions but requires manual resume editing. No automation for tailoring or application submission.</p>

      <h3>Resume Quality and Tailoring</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with keyword optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobscan:</strong> Shows keyword matches and missing terms but requires manual editing. No automatic resume generation or tailoring.</p>

      <h3>Time to Value</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> See tailored resumes and applications within minutes. Auto-apply accelerates volume for remote roles.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobscan:</strong> Faster scanning and feedback. Value in optimization insights, but manual editing adds time per application.</p>

      <h3>Friction and Limitations</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Less focus on detailed scanning reports.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobscan:</strong> No auto-apply or job board means manual application process. Resume tailoring requires manual work. Free tier limits scans. No automatic optimization.</p>
