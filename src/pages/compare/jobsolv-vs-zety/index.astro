      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse integrated job board, get AI-tailored resume for each position, approve and auto-apply. Complete application workflow in one platform.</p>
      <p><strong>Zety:</strong> Choose template, build resume with content suggestions, create cover letter, export resume, apply manually to jobs elsewhere. Resume builder only, no application workflow.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically per job. Auto-apply handles submission for supported roles. You review tailored resumes (30-60 seconds) before applying.</p>
      <p><strong>Zety:</strong> Provides templates and content suggestions but requires manual customization per job. No automation for tailoring or application submission.</p>

      <h3>Resume Quality and Tailoring</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with keyword optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>Zety:</strong> Offers professional templates and content suggestions but requires manual customization per job. No automatic per-job tailoring or keyword optimization.</p>

      <h3>Time to Value</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> See tailored resumes and applications within minutes. Auto-apply accelerates volume for remote roles.</p>
      <p><strong>Zety:</strong> Faster initial resume creation with templates and suggestions. Value in polished resumes, but manual customization adds time per application.</p>

      <h3>Friction and Limitations</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Less focus on cover letter generation.</p>
      <p><strong>Zety:</strong> No auto-apply or job board means manual application process. Resume tailoring requires manual work. Premium needed for PDF/Word downloads. No per-job automatic optimization.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>Zety provides templates and content suggestions but requires manual customization per job. Jobsolv automatically tailors your resume for each job, matching keywords and skills from each job description.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Manually customizing resumes takes hours → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Automatic per-job customization in seconds</p>

      <h3>2. Auto-Apply Capability</h3>
      <p>Zety is a resume builder only; you must apply manually elsewhere. Jobsolv can auto-apply to remote/hybrid roles, saving significant time.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Applying to many jobs takes hours → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Automated submissions while you focus on interviews</p>

      <h3>3. Integrated Job Board</h3>
      <p>Browse, tailor, and apply all in one platform with curated remote/hybrid roles. Zety has no job board; you must find jobs elsewhere.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Switching between job boards and tools → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Complete workflow in one place</p>

      <h3>4. Better ATS Optimization</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv formats resumes specifically for ATS systems per job with keyword matching. Zety templates are ATS-friendly but don't automatically optimize for each job's keywords.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Resumes rejected by ATS filters → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher pass rates with optimized formatting</p>

      <h3>5. Complete Application Workflow</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv provides job board, resume tailoring, and application submission in one platform. Zety is resume-only, requiring separate tools for job search and applications.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Managing multiple tools is inefficient → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Everything in one platform</p>
