      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse integrated job board, review AI-tailored resume for each position, approve and apply. You see and control every step with per-job customization.</p>
      <p><strong>ApplyAI:</strong> Configure preferences, AI handles applications automatically in background. Less visibility into what's being sent or when applications go out.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically per job. You review each one (30-60 seconds) before applying. This ensures quality while maintaining speed.</p>
      <p><strong>ApplyAI:</strong> Fully automated background process. Once configured, applies without your involvement. Zero manual effort but less control over customization.</p>

      <h3>Resume Quality and Tailoring</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with keyword optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>ApplyAI:</strong> Uses AI for application automation but may not tailor resumes per job as specifically. Bulk automation may reduce relevance for specific roles.</p>

      <h3>Time to Value</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> See tailored resumes and applications within minutes. Integrated board means no switching between tools.</p>
      <p><strong>ApplyAI:</strong> Once configured, runs automatically in background. Faster initial setup but less control over application quality.</p>

      <h3>Friction and Limitations</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Free tier has credit limits.</p>
      <p><strong>ApplyAI:</strong> Limited transparency into applications being sent. May require payment to use. No integrated job board or per-job tailoring focus.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>ApplyAI automates applications but may not tailor resumes for each specific job. Jobsolv customizes your resume for every application, matching keywords and skills from each job description.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Generic resumes get rejected → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher interview rates with targeted applications</p>

      <h3>2. Integrated Job Board</h3>
      <p>Browse, tailor, and apply all in one platform with curated remote/hybrid roles. ApplyAI works across external sources but doesn't provide an integrated board.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> No visibility into job sources → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Browse curated jobs and see exactly what you're applying to</p>

      <h3>3. Full Control and Transparency</h3>
      <p>You see and approve every application before it's sent. ApplyAI applies in the background with limited visibility into what employers receive.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Worried about sending wrong information → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Complete control over every application</p>

      <h3>4. Free Tier Access</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv offers a forever-free plan that includes access to the job board, resume builder, job tracker, and limited resume tailoring. ApplyAI may require payment to use.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Can't afford paid services while unemployed → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Start applying immediately at zero cost</p>

      <h3>5. Better Application Quality</h3>
      <p>Per-job tailoring typically generates higher interview rates than bulk automated applications. Jobsolv ensures each application is optimized for the specific role.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Low callback rates from automated applications → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher quality applications that get noticed</p>

      <h3>Background Processing</h3>
      <p>ApplyAI works continuously in the background, applying to new jobs as they appear. Jobsolv requires you to browse and approve each application.</p>
