      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse integrated job board, get AI-tailored resume for each position, approve and auto-apply. Streamlined application workflow in one platform.</p>
      <p><strong>Teal HQ:</strong> Choose resume template, customize manually, track applications across multiple sources, manage career goals. More comprehensive but more manual steps.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically per job. Auto-apply handles submission for supported roles. You review tailored resumes (30-60 seconds) before applying.</p>
      <p><strong>Teal HQ:</strong> Provides templates and tracking but requires manual resume customization and application submission. More control but more work per application.</p>

      <h3>Resume Quality and Tailoring</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with keyword optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>Teal HQ:</strong> Offers extensive templates but requires manual customization per job. No automatic per-job tailoring or keyword optimization.</p>

      <h3>Time to Value</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> See tailored resumes and applications within minutes. Auto-apply accelerates volume for remote roles.</p>
      <p><strong>Teal HQ:</strong> Faster initial resume creation with templates. Value in organization and tracking, but manual customization adds time per application.</p>

      <h3>Friction and Limitations</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Less focus on career planning features.</p>
      <p><strong>Teal HQ:</strong> No auto-apply means manual submission for every application. Resume tailoring requires manual work. Premium needed for advanced features.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>Teal HQ provides templates but requires manual customization per job. Jobsolv automatically tailors your resume for each job, matching keywords and skills from each job description.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Manually customizing resumes takes hours → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Automatic per-job customization in seconds</p>

      <h3>2. Auto-Apply Capability</h3>
      <p>Teal HQ doesn't offer auto-apply; you must submit every application manually. Jobsolv can auto-apply to remote/hybrid roles, saving significant time.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Applying to many jobs takes hours → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Automated submissions while you focus on interviews</p>

      <h3>3. Integrated Job Board</h3>
      <p>Browse, tailor, and apply all in one platform with curated remote/hybrid roles. Teal HQ aggregates jobs but doesn't provide an integrated application workflow.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Switching between job boards and tools → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Complete workflow in one place</p>

      <h3>4. Better ATS Optimization</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv formats resumes specifically for ATS systems per job. Teal HQ templates are ATS-friendly but don't automatically optimize for each job's keywords.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Resumes rejected by ATS filters → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher pass rates with optimized formatting</p>

      <h3>5. Faster Application Process</h3>
      <p>Per-job tailoring and auto-apply mean you can apply to more jobs in less time. Teal HQ's manual process is slower for high-volume applications.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Job search takes too long → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Apply to more jobs faster with automation</p>
