      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse jobs on integrated board, review AI-tailored resume for each position, approve and apply. You see and control every step.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobhire.ai:</strong> Platform automates bulk applications on your behalf. Focuses on sending maximum applications with minimal customization.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically. You review each one (30-60 seconds) before applying. This ensures quality while maintaining speed.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobhire.ai:</strong> Automates bulk applications to save time. Once configured, sends applications with minimal involvement from you.</p>

      <h3>Output Quality</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobhire.ai:</strong> Uses AI resume rewriting but not per-job tailoring. Focuses on volume, which may reduce relevance for specific roles.</p>

      <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Simple setup—create profile, upload resume, start browsing. The platform guides you through each step.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobhire.ai:</strong> Requires initial configuration for automation. Once set, runs with minimal ongoing input.</p>

      <h3>Friction Points</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Free tier has credit limits.</p>
      <p><strong>Jobhire.ai:</strong> No free tier. Less focus on per-job customization. No integrated job tracker.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Free Access to Start</h3>
      <p>Jobhire.ai requires payment to use. Jobsolv's free tier lets you test the platform, browse jobs, and apply with tailored resumes before committing any money.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Can't afford paid services while unemployed → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Start applying immediately at zero cost</p>

      <h3>2. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>Jobhire.ai uses AI resume rewriting but doesn't tailor resumes for each specific job. Jobsolv customizes your resume for every application, matching keywords and skills from each job description.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Generic resumes get rejected → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher interview rates with targeted applications</p>

      <h3>3. Outcomes Over Volume</h3>
      <p>Jobhire.ai helps you send more applications. Jobsolv helps you get results. Tailored applications typically convert 2-3x better than generic bulk submissions.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Sending many applications but getting no interviews → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Better interview rates with fewer, better applications</p>

      <h3>4. Integrated Platform</h3>
      <p>Job board, resume builder, tailoring, and tracking in one place. Jobhire.ai focuses on automation but lacks integrated tools for the full job search workflow.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Managing multiple disconnected tools → <strong>Outcome:</strong> One platform for entire job search</p>

      <h3>5. Built-in Job Tracker</h3>
      <p>Track all applications, interviews, and follow-ups in one place. Jobhire.ai doesn't include tracking—you'd need a separate tool.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Losing track of applications → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Organized job search with clear visibility</p>
