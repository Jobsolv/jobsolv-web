      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse specialized remote/hybrid job board, get AI-matched jobs, review tailored resume for each position, approve and apply—all in one platform. Integrated application process.</p>
      <p><strong>We Work Remotely:</strong> Browse remote job listings, click to view details, apply through external company sites. Traditional job board experience with external applications only.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically for each job. You review each one (30-60 seconds) before applying. Job matching happens automatically based on your profile.</p>
      <p><strong>We Work Remotely:</strong> Requires manual job browsing and searching. No automatic resume tailoring. You must customize applications yourself or use the same resume for all. All applications go through external company sites.</p>

      <h3>Output Quality</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with ATS optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>We Work Remotely:</strong> Uses your uploaded resume for all applications. No per-job customization unless you manually edit. Quality depends on your resume optimization skills.</p>

      <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Simple setup—create profile, upload resume, start browsing. The platform guides you through tailoring and applications.</p>
      <p><strong>We Work Remotely:</strong> Straightforward job board interface. Requires learning effective search strategies and resume optimization. Similar to traditional job boards.</p>

      <h3>Friction Points</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Free tier has credit limits for premium features.</p>
      <p><strong>We Work Remotely:</strong> No automatic resume tailoring. Requires manual job searching and application customization. All applications redirect to external company sites. No integrated tracking or resume tools.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>We Work Remotely is a listing board only—no resume tailoring. Jobsolv customizes your resume for every job, matching keywords and skills from each job description. This significantly improves ATS pass rates and interview conversion.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Generic applications get rejected → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher interview rates with targeted applications</p>

      <h3>2. Integrated Application Platform</h3>
      <p>Job board, resume builder, tailoring, and tracking in one place. We Work Remotely is a job board only—you still need separate tools for resume optimization, tailoring, and application tracking.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Managing multiple disconnected tools → <strong>Outcome:</strong> One platform for browsing, tailoring, and applying</p>

      <h3>3. AI-Powered Job Matching</h3>
      <p>Jobs come to you based on your profile. No manual searching required. We Work Remotely requires manual job browsing and searching, which takes time.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Spending hours searching job boards → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Relevant jobs matched automatically</p>

      <h3>4. Built-in Resume Builder and Tracker</h3>
      <p>Create and optimize resumes, then track all applications in one platform. We Work Remotely offers job listings only—no resume tools or tracking.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Using separate tools for resumes and tracking → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Complete job search workflow in one place</p>

      <h3>5. Less Competition</h3>
      <p>We Work Remotely has over 34,000 listings and attracts millions of users. Jobsolv's specialized remote/hybrid focus means less competition per job. You're not competing against We Work Remotely's entire user base.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Getting lost among hundreds of applicants → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Better visibility in less crowded marketplace</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is Jobsolv free like We Work Remotely?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Both platforms offer free job browsing. Jobsolv's free tier also includes resume tailoring, resume builder, and job tracker, which We Work Remotely doesn't offer.</p>

      <h3>Does We Work Remotely tailor resumes for each job?</h3>
      <p>No. We Work Remotely is a job listing board only. It doesn't offer resume tailoring or application tools. Jobsolv automatically tailors your resume for each job posting.</p>

      <h3>Which platform has more remote job listings?</h3>
      <p>We Work Remotely may have more listings across all salary levels due to longer history and larger user base. Jobsolv focuses on remote/hybrid roles paying $100K+, so the pool is more targeted but smaller.</p>

      <h3>Which tool gets more interviews?</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv typically generates higher interview rates per application because each resume is tailored to the specific job. We Work Remotely provides access to more jobs, but without tailoring, individual application success rates may be lower.</p>
