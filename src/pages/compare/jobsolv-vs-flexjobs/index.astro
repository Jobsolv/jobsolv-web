      <h2>How They Actually Differ</h2>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Browse specialized remote/hybrid job board, get AI-matched jobs, review tailored resume for each position, approve and apply—all in one platform. Integrated application process.</p>
      <p><strong>FlexJobs:</strong> Browse curated remote job listings, search and filter manually, upload resume, apply through external company sites. Traditional job board experience with external applications.</p>

      <h3>Automation vs Manual Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> AI tailors resumes automatically for each job. You review each one (30-60 seconds) before applying. Job matching happens automatically based on your profile.</p>
      <p><strong>FlexJobs:</strong> Requires manual job searching and filtering. No automatic resume tailoring. You must customize applications yourself or use the same resume for all.</p>

      <h3>Output Quality</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Each resume is tailored to match specific job requirements with ATS optimization. Higher interview rates because applications are precisely targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>FlexJobs:</strong> Uses your uploaded resume for all applications. No per-job customization unless you manually edit. Quality depends on your resume optimization skills.</p>

      <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Simple setup—create profile, upload resume, start browsing. The platform guides you through tailoring and applications.</p>
      <p><strong>FlexJobs:</strong> Straightforward job board interface, but requires learning effective search strategies and resume optimization. Similar to traditional job boards.</p>

      <h3>Friction Points</h3>
      <p><strong>Jobsolv:</strong> Requires reviewing each tailored resume (adds 30-60 seconds per application). Free tier has credit limits for premium features.</p>
      <p><strong>FlexJobs:</strong> Requires paid subscription to access job listings. No automatic resume tailoring. Requires manual job searching and application customization. Applications redirect to external company sites.</p>

      <h2>Why Jobsolv Wins</h2>

      <h3>1. Free Access to Core Features</h3>
      <p>FlexJobs requires a paid subscription to access job listings. Jobsolv's free tier includes the job board, resume builder, job tracker, and limited resume tailoring. You can start applying immediately without payment.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Can't afford paid job boards while unemployed → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Start applying immediately at zero cost</p>

      <h3>2. Per-Job Resume Tailoring</h3>
      <p>FlexJobs uses your uploaded resume for all applications with no customization. Jobsolv customizes your resume for every job, matching keywords and skills from each job description. This significantly improves ATS pass rates and interview conversion.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Generic applications get rejected → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Higher interview rates with targeted applications</p>

      <h3>3. Integrated Application Platform</h3>
      <p>Job board, resume builder, tailoring, and tracking in one place. FlexJobs is a job board only—you still need separate tools for resume optimization, tailoring, and application tracking.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Managing multiple disconnected tools → <strong>Outcome:</strong> One platform for browsing, tailoring, and applying</p>

      <h3>4. AI-Powered Job Matching</h3>
      <p>Jobs come to you based on your profile. No manual searching required. FlexJobs requires manual job searching and filtering, which takes time.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Spending hours searching job boards → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Relevant jobs matched automatically</p>

      <h3>5. Human-Reviewed Listings</h3>
      <p>Jobsolv manually vets each job listing before it goes live, protecting you from scams. While FlexJobs has extensive pre-screening, Jobsolv offers similar protection at no cost.</p>
      <p><strong>User pain solved:</strong> Wasting time on scam listings → <strong>Outcome:</strong> Legitimate jobs only, verified before posting</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Where FlexJobs Is Stronger</h2>

      <h3>Extensive Job Curation</h3>
      <p>FlexJobs has a longer history of curating remote jobs and may have more listings across all salary levels. Jobsolv focuses on $100K+ remote/hybrid roles, so the job pool is more targeted.</p>

      <h3>Comprehensive Scam Protection</h3>
      <p>FlexJobs is known for extensive pre-screening and scam verification. While Jobsolv also reviews listings, FlexJobs has a longer track record in this area.</p>
