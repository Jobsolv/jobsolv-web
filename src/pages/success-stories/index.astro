      <h2>Background & Starting Point</h2>
      <p>
        Aiko was laid off from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and hadn't been job searching for a couple of years. Her resume wasn't updated, and the prospect of getting back into the routine of applying for positions felt overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was hesitant about using a job search service because she wasn't sure how it would work or whether it would be worth the investment. Like many professionals who've been out of the job market, she needed help navigating the current hiring landscape.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Problem They Were Facing</h2>
      <p>
        Aiko faced several challenges common to professionals returning to the job market:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Outdated resume that didn't reflect current hiring standards</li>
        <li>Overwhelming process of finding and applying to relevant positions</li>
        <li>Time-consuming manual application process</li>
        <li>Uncertainty about how to effectively present her skills and experience</li>
        <li>Stress and mental burden of managing a job search while unemployed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before using Jobsolv, Aiko had landed only 4 interviews through her own efforts, despite spending 40+ hours applying to jobs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Changed with Jobsolv</h2>
      <p>
        Once Aiko signed up, Jobsolv addressed her concerns systematically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meticulously rewrote her resume to highlight her skills and experience</li>
        <li>Found over 200 personalized job opportunities that matched her background</li>
        <li>Applied to positions on her behalf, saving her 40+ hours of manual work</li>
        <li>Tailored each application to match specific job descriptions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aiko also had the option to provide her own job listings, and Jobsolv would tailor her applications to each job description, ensuring a strong fit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "I even had the option to provide them with job listings that I was interested in, and Jobsolv tailored my applications to each job description, ensuring a fit that was nothing short of perfect."
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Jobsolv Was Used in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Aiko used Jobsolv's <a href="/features/resume-tailoring">resume tailoring</a> feature to ensure each application was customized for the specific role. The platform handled the time-consuming application process, while Aiko could focus on interview preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="/features/job-tracker">job tracker</a> helped her stay organized and monitor her application progress. As the service progressed, the quality of matches improved, and the consistent flow of interviews restored her confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aiko appreciated the flexibility—she could let the team manage applications entirely, or provide her own job listings for tailored applications. The experience felt personalized to her needs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "My favorite thing about Jobsolv is that it works! I was able to travel and actually relax, knowing that I was making meaningful progress in my job search. The flexibility in how I used the service was amazing. Whether you're letting the team manage applications or providing your own job listings, the experience feels tailored to you."

      <h2>The Results</h2>
      <p>
        Within two months of working with Jobsolv, Aiko saw a clear shift in her job search outcomes:
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Metric</th>
            <th>Before Jobsolv</th>
            <th>With Jobsolv</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Interviews Landed</strong></td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>18</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Base Salary</strong></td>
            <td>$120K</td>
            <td>$180K+</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Time Spent Applying</strong></td>
            <td>40+ hours</td>
            <td>0 hours (saved by Jobsolv)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Pay Increase</strong></td>
            <td>—</td>
            <td>25% increase</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        The interviews Aiko secured were for roles offering salaries around $150,000—a 25% increase from her previous role at SVB. The position she ultimately accepted at OKX offered her a $60K base salary increase and was in a specialty she had been interested in pursuing.

      <h2>Why This Approach Worked</h2>
      <p>
        Jobsolv didn't magically create opportunities. It replaced manual work, guesswork, and scattered effort with a repeatable system. Here's what made the difference:

      <article>
        <h3>Reduced Stress and Increased Freedom</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most significant benefits for Aiko was how Jobsolv completely took over her job search. Her stress levels were drastically reduced, and her free time increased exponentially. This allowed her to focus on personal growth and interview preparation.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "My stress levels were drastically reduced, and my free time exponentially increased. It allowed me to focus on personal growth and interview preparation, knowing that my job applications were being actively managed and optimized. During unemployment, mental well-being is so important, and having that burden lifted allowed me to travel and relax, without the stress of a job search hanging over me."
        </blockquote>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Personalized Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Jobsolv adapted to how Aiko wanted to search, not the other way around. She could provide her own job listings or let the system find opportunities. The experience felt tailored to her specific needs and preferences.
