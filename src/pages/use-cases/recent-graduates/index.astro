        Your path to your first job starts here. Land your first job without guessing, rewriting, or getting ignored.

      <p>
        Graduating doesn't automatically unlock opportunities. Most recent grads struggle not because they lack potential but because hiring systems, competition, and unclear expectations work against them. Resume filters block your opportunities before anyone sees your potential.

      <h2>The Problem Recent Graduates Face</h2>
      <p>
        The job market isn't broken. It's just not built for graduates. You're not imagining it—the system is stacked against you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resume filters that block your opportunities before anyone sees your potential</li>
        <li>Lack of experience that makes it hard to stand out</li>
        <li>Unclear expectations about what employers actually want</li>
        <li>Competition from hundreds of other applicants</li>
        <li>No clear system for tracking applications and following up</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most platforms assume you already know how hiring works. Jobsolv is built for people at the start of their careers—when clarity matters more than complexity.
