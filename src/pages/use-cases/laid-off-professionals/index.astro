      <p>
        Getting laid off doesn't define your value. Get back to work faster without losing momentum or confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Layoffs aren't personal—they're business decisions. But that doesn't make the job search easier. Most laid-off professionals struggle with time pressure, confidence loss, and outdated resumes. The longer you wait, the harder it gets to maintain momentum.

      <h2>The Problem Laid-Off Professionals Face</h2>
      <p>
        Job searching after a layoff comes with unique pressures that make everything harder:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time pressure from financial concerns and resume gaps</li>
        <li>Confidence loss from being let go, even when it wasn't your fault</li>
        <li>Age discrimination concerns, especially for mid-to-senior professionals</li>
        <li>Outdated resumes that don't reflect your current value</li>
        <li>No clear system for applying at scale while maintaining quality</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most platforms assume you have time to figure things out. Jobsolv helps you move fast without sacrificing quality.
