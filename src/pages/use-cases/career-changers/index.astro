      <p>
        Your career pivot doesn't have to mean starting from zero. Land your next role in a new industry without rewriting your entire story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing careers isn't about having the wrong experience—it's about presenting it wrong. Most career changers struggle because hiring systems don't see transferable skills. Your resume gets filtered before anyone understands what you can actually do.

      <h2>The Problem Career Changers Face</h2>
      <p>
        The job market rewards specialization, not versatility. When you're changing careers, the system works against you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resume filters that reject you for not having "exact" experience</li>
        <li>Difficulty explaining how your past work applies to new roles</li>
        <li>Age bias concerns when pivoting mid-career</li>
        <li>Uncertainty about which skills actually transfer</li>
        <li>No clear system for positioning your pivot as a strength</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most platforms assume you're staying in the same field. Jobsolv helps you bridge the gap between where you've been and where you want to go.
