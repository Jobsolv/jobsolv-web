      <h1>Jobsolv Use Cases</h1>
      <p>
        Not all job searches are the same. What works for a recent graduate won't work for someone switching careers. What helps a laid-off professional differs from what a senior executive needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jobsolv adapts to where you are in your career. Each use case below addresses the specific constraints and challenges you face right now.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Different Job Seekers Need Different Approaches</h2>
      <p>
        Your job search strategy should match your situation. A recent graduate needs help highlighting coursework and projects. A career changer needs to reframe existing experience. A laid-off professional needs to get back in the market quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generic job search advice doesn't work because it ignores your specific constraints. These pages show you exactly how Jobsolv's <a href="/features/resume-builder">resume builder</a>, <a href="/features/resume-tailoring">resume tailoring</a>, and <a href="/features/job-tracker">job tracker</a> features solve your specific problems.
